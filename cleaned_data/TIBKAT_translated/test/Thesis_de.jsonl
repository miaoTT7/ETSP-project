From the introduction: The number of great-mice breeding pairs, which colonize certain biotopes annually, varies considerably from year to year. The aim of this work is to determine the annual dynamics of a great-mice population in the region Schlüchtern-Steinau (Hessen) between 1972 and 1977. It is to be shown, among other things, to what extent migrations (inward and outward migration) take place outside and at the beginning of the breeding period and how strongly this breeding and winter population influence. To achieve this, not only breeding biological parameters have been recorded, but further important information has been collected through intensive net-catching of feeding places and by night-time controls of nesting caves in winter.

This work presents a solution proposal for the realization of service quality in Ethernet networks. The central element for this is a software system consisting of a middleware which regulates communication in the network according to the specifications. This approach was theoretically conceived as well as practically programmed. The implementation of the solution served as the basis for the performance evaluation of the presented approach. In addition to the evaluation of the characteristic behavior of the middleware under various requirements, investigations and alternatives are presented which show how the system can be adapted in terms of the requirements that arise with larger networks. The presented solution approach offers an alternative to existing service quality functions, which are implemented by means of communication protocols and Ethernet hardware. The advantage of the middleware is that it works independently of the functions of the network, so that no special specifications need to be set to the communication infrastructure. Since the realization of service quality is implemented purely by the software of the middleware, all degrees of freedom are given in addition, in order to freely adapt the service quality concept to the service quality to individual needs.", "title_en": "LINDA : Performance management in networks with service quality adaptation - using the example of an Ethernet middleware"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4127501-9", "gnd:4426067-2", "gnd:4496068-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Hager, Markus", "year": "2017", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

Not only the life expectancy, but also optical properties, such as the luminous flux and the colour of the light, depend on the chip temperature of the LED. As a result of a pronounced temperature dependence, the development process of the LED systems is very complex. This complexity is due to the larger number of interconnected elements that are realized in different disciplines. Due to this fact, there is a need for a cross-disciplinary development process that takes into account the tasks, problems and requirements of all disciplines. Within the scope of this work, a possible interlinking of the thermomanagement-relevant disciplines relevant for the error-free functionality of the thermomanagement with the engineering approach in product development was specified. The result is a systematic system that structures the development process of the LED systems and arranges suitable methods and tools for thermomanagement. The applicability of the development system was presented on the basis of the design of two demonstrators.

The present dissertation is dedicated to the question of the establishment and development of modern social institutions in so-called non-Western societies. Iranian society serves here as the case study to paradigmatically place social, economic and cultural relations in a non-Western society. For empirical support, the work uses above all a historical-sociological perspective on Iran. It is based as a theory foundation on the theory of social acceleration and it is argued that the different types of functional mechanisms and potential connections of motors of social acceleration draw correspondingly different accelerated social formations or social constellations. A detailed study of the modes and motors of social acceleration, their functioning and mutual linkages, forms the basis for understanding the problem of the establishment of an accelerating social formation in Iranian society. It is shown that in the course of the 20th century the three motors of social acceleration in Iranian society had to fight continuously with three corresponding problems: the „autocratic modernization measures (the economic engine) and the „structurally unenthusive differentiation\" (the motor).", "title_en": "The social acceleration in non-Western societies: the case study Iran"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4144870-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1160488061; gnd:36164-1", "year": "2018", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

Unlike the hydrogen bridge, the halogen bridge closely related to it has a higher directionality, a greater covalent bonding component and a stronger interaction with a Lewis-basic partner, thus enabling the construction of potentially more selective receptors. An important heterocycle, which enables a simple implementation of halogen bridge bonds into various systems through its modular access, is the halogenated 1,2,3 triazole or the corresponding triazolium salt.

Land use is an old-known problem in Germany. The policy is aware of the effects at the latest since the 1970s. Political objectives, for example in the sustainability strategy of the Federal Government, are repeatedly presented. The construction planning law plays a decisive role in this. The work illustrates for the first time comprehensively and in detail that the building planning law holds a large number of options for a reduction of the area use available and at the same time examines whether it is sufficiently equipped to push forward an extensive area use. The numerous measures for a reduction of the area use are highlighted by examples and precise definitions and placed in a ranking order. In each measure the relevant standards are presented and weighted. The work covers both the presentation and fixing possibilities in the building guidance plans, the planning objectives and planning guidelines of the consideration, the planning replacement regulations as well as the measures of the special town building law.

On the one hand, the presence of certain compounds in nature is often limited, so that synthetic methods increasingly replace a less sustainable degradation. On the other hand, the physiological effect or bioavailability of an active substance can be increased by derivatization and drug adaptation. In this work, some representatives of the known active substances C-Arylglycosides and Chalkone were first synthesized by the key step of the palladium-catalysed MATSUDA-HECK reaction. On the other hand, in the case of C-Arylglycosides, unsaturated carbohydrates (glycalides) were first described above via a ruthenium-catalysed cyclolysis reaction.

An indication of the change in individual careers is the increasing number of persons who pursue more than just a career. This phenomenon addresses the present work by examining narrative interviews of double-employed people. The focus is on the analysis of the research questions why individuals voluntarily pursue two jobs simultaneously and how they design their careers. The results show that the career concept of self-determined double-employment can be linked to the satisfaction of work-related needs and enable optimisation of these needs. These findings partly underpin the concepts of the new career idea and reflect the three psychological basic needs of autonomous, relatedness and competence of self-determination theory (SDT). The integration of this motivation theory into the present analysis also confirms a fruitful and comprehensive interdisciplinary connection between SDT and career research. Moreover, the extensive understanding of career as a resultantly critical and thus discusses the significance of the experience of the two different occupational environments.", "title_en": "The best of two divergent working environments: an analysis of individual career patterns and concepts of people in a double job, including self-determining theory"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4003974-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1183862962; gnd:35534-3", "year": "2019", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

Dryness and heat waves affect our society and vegetation. Especially in relation to climate change the effects on vegetation are of particular importance. In the global carbon cycle terrestrial ecosystems are usually sinks of carbon dioxide, but can transform during and after climate extreme events into carbon sources. A crucial aspect here is the role of different plant species and vegetation types on different scales that influence the effects on the carbon cycle. Although physiological differences between different plant species are obvious different reactions to extreme events, these differences are not systematically evaluated and fully understood at global level. Another aspect is that climate extreme events are from nature multivariate. For example, hot air can absorb more water than cold air. Extreme events with strong effects were in the past often multivariate, as for example in Europe 2003, Russia 2012, or the USA 2012.

The implementation of inclusive school education raises questions about the professionalization of prospective teachers – in particular, the importance of the respective school and educational orientations is emphasized. At the same time, it is striking in the discussions about inclusion that the students themselves speak only little. The study takes up these findings by focusing both on the addressee of the pupils and that of the students and by asking how the students refer to the views of students in their understanding of inclusion. The documentary analysis of student orientations shows that students hardly perceive the voices of the pupils as independent positions, but rather rather use them as a starting point for shaping their own future position in the school. The results are illuminated under a praxeological perspective on teacher professionalism and provide information on which differentiation-related norms become effective and from which students make use of the requirements and also of the teaching.", "title_en": "Students – Students – Inclusion : Orientations on the way to differential-sensitive teacher education?"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4201275-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1176156756", "year": "2021", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

In this work, the spectral properties of singular Sturm-Liouville differential operators of the form Af=1/r((pf') + qf) with real-value coefficients p, q and r are investigated.

Based on findings of the relative oscillation theory as well as the floquet theory for periodic Sturm-Liouville operators, criteria are demonstrated which ensure the stability of essential spectra under disturbance of the coefficients. In addition, the accumulation of self-values in the gaps of the essential spectrum is investigated. We formulate conditions that imply an accumulation of self-values within a gap or exclude an accumulation.

These articles provide comprehensive protection against the most modern forms of surveillance, including mass surveillance. Concrete criteria for the certainty of the surveillance laws apply. The monitoring must also be approved and controlled by independent authorities and effective remedies must be available.

The use of glasses, especially ultra-thin glass, is restricted in numerous innovative applications by their brittle fracture behaviour. In the present work a new, ready-to-work edge resistance measurement method for ultra-thin glass samples is described, compared with established strength testing methods and found to be suitable for use. In the further course of the work, an edge resistance optimized scratch and break process for ultra-thin glass is developed by the construction of new machine components using a high number of tested samples and advanced statistical methods. In addition, it is demonstrated that the strength resulting from the process can be predicted by means of a linear model when a cutting liquid is used. A large amount of tested samples are then demonstrated that the resulting strength follows a 3-parameter cross-section and therefore has a strength threshold below which the fracture probability is negligible in engineering terms.

The lack of affordable charging opportunities, especially in the countryside, inhibits the spread of climate-friendly drive technology.

Water vapor is one of the most important atmospheric trace gases. Its influence on the climate, chemistry and energy balance is significant. Of particular interest is the distribution of water vapour in the upper troposphere, especially in the tropics. The most important water vapour source for the tropical upper troposphere is tropical convection. It counteracts the large-scale sinking that has its cause both in the dynamics and in the radiation budget. It compensates for the convective upward movement and transports relatively dry air downwards. The net effect of these two processes is little known, especially due to a lack of reliable measurements in this region.

A wide selection of sources shows how different \"death and death\" was brought to the attention of the 19th century: church songs interpret death differently than catechisms, dogma books do not interpret the daily life of the Catholic Church.", "title_en": "A coffin and a funeral dress : Death and death in the 19th century ; on the history of Catholicism in South West Germany"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4060294-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:12008550X", "year": "2004", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

The security of enterprise application systems is becoming increasingly a decisive factor for the continued existence of enterprises. This results on the one hand from the availability requirements for systems and data required for the business's workflows, and on the other hand from external requirements such as the Data Protection Act. In order to be able to assess an application system with regard to security, the threat and risk analysis identifies risks. On the other hand, the risks identified in this way must be addressed by appropriate modification of the application system. In the consistent implementation of the analysis and subsequent protection, the analyst is insufficiently and partially supported by the existing approach models. This work therefore deals with a consistent approach model for the threat and risk analysis of application systems and their protection by integrating security mechanisms. In this approach model, the analysis results are based on possible risk-based security mechanisms and their impact on risk development and the associated costs.

This work deals with light deflection in the post-linear gravitational field of a system of two bound point masses.

The book explains, on the basis of a broad survey, the decision-making behaviour regarding the choice of transport means in freight transport. Since external costs are caused to a considerable extent by a sharp increase in transport demand in freight transport, transport policy must take specific measures to make this additional demand as environmentally sound as possible. Therefore, the EU and the Federal Government aim to shift traffic from road to alternative transport modes. This work analyses the determinants of the choice of transport means of transport of freight forwarders, in order to then determine the effect of certain regulations.

It is repeatedly claimed that social welfare recipients decide against the inclusion of work because of lack of wage incentives and thus remain permanently in poverty (poverty trap theorem).

Ronald Gebauer examines in a first step historically-sociologically the view that work is the key to solving the poverty problem in modern societies. In a further step, the theoretical foundations of poverty trap theorem are discussed. But what about the reality of the poverty trap theorem?

The idea of automatically connecting related texts to each other is not new. The solution approach presented in this work pursues two main objectives: to work automatically on the basis of unstructured texts and to support a high number of simultaneous accesses. It differs from other methods essentially by determining the semantic distance between the texts based on an asymmetric precalculated distance matrix. The relationships between unstructured text objects are established by means of a heuristic algorithm for the selection of characteristics independent of the national language. The resulting \"wort cloud\" is then used as a request parameter for the selection of suitable texts. The user is recommended to use the currently displayed text related to content. The processing speed of the procedure was analysed in the form of the runtime complexity of the algorithms.

Cement and plastic achieve a joint binder effect in the later mortar or concrete. Repeated object of damage is the failure of the bonding compound to other building substance. Since PCC is often applied as a thin protective layer on existing concrete, a failure of the adhesion sooner or later also leads to a failure of this protective function. Conversely, a failure of protection due to cracks in the PCC can also lead to the subsequent removal of the coating. In this case, the primary reason for this cohesive failure is the selection of false or non-conformative building material systems or simply processing errors.

With the rapid increase in the speed of electronic components, systems with increased complexity, networking and heterogeneity can be developed.

The starting point of the paper is the political requirement for the reduction of land sealing and water use in Germany. This ecological goal is implemented by the creation of an economic model for the control of land sealing and water use on the basis of environmental certificates. Starting from an empirical survey on existing environmental governance in the USA and Germany as well as model theory approaches in the literature, a separate economic control model is gradually developed on the basis of tradable environmental certificates. The plant is thus internationally and interdisciplinary at the interface between ecology, economics and legal science. The pre- and post-supposing effect of the control model has been particularly important for SMEs in the context of the area recycling of former farm areas as well as for the municipalities with regard to the degradation of the industrial area overhang. Against this background, the control model can be considered as an appropriate balance between the politically pre- and post-supposing quantity limitation, the interests of SMEs and the municipalities on the one side, and the preservation of the economic management of the environment as an environmental policy.", "title_en": "Environmental certificates as economic control instruments and their impact on small and medium-sized enterprises: a comparative study of the taxability of land sealing and water use in Germany and the USA"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4122086-9", "gnd:4114030-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:137793715", "year": "2010", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

How does the support of the political system by the members of society affect their political participation? So far, research literature has assumed that people with a strong support of the political system use more written political forms of participation, while people with a low support use rather unwritten political forms of participation. Dominik Allenspach argues that the effects are u-shaped. This means that people with a strong and low support of the political system use unwritten political forms of participation, while people who are indifferent to the political system do not participate politically. The author has examined the existence of these effects for various Western democracies.

Summary: In special magneto-optical electronic materials, such as Ga1-xMnxAs, the electronic and magnetic properties are set by the concentration of the charge carrier determining component, here by the Mn. However, changes in the chemical composition also lead to a change in the system order. An excellent way to approach this problem is to use external electrostatic fields to obtain a doping effect without changing the composition. This approach not only allows for a development of novel components but can also be used to investigate quantum phenomena, since the basic state in such systems can be controlled. Epitactic nanostructures are suitable candidates, since they allow the required quantum inclusion. Therefore, an elastic grid tension due to a grid mismatch can be used to influence the observed quantum effects.

It was found that the germination rate in all investigated lead species significantly increases with increasing population size and the germination density in the open-air area in two species. In all other fitness parameters only few significant results were found. The studies in the present work show that species-specific reactions to the changes in relevant parameters such as the population size are of great importance for the survival of a species. The results of the diaspore bank studies confirm the statements from the literature that the predominant number of typical lime-magerra species is not able to build a permanent diasporen bank.

Acoustic signaling is a central mode of behaviour of acrocephalinae. Their vocals exhibit an enormous variety with considerable inter-art variation. To what extent this vocal variation is more due to adaptive adaptations to morphological, ecological or social factors or to homologous development through phylogeny, is not investigated as much as the complex interaction of these factors. To examine this question, I identified the vocals according to various vocal characteristics, and then compared them with the above factors and corrected the result phylogenically. It shows an unequal influence of the factors on the vocal characteristics. The most important influence have the phylogeny and sexual selection. Through the increased sexual function of the vocals in attracting acrocephalinae these differ in repertoire size and singing place from non-tracting species.

The Wind 2 Vehicle (W2V) method is an example of the use of controlled charging of EVs to realize a renewable feed-in demand. The Local Load Management (LLM) is an example of using information from the distribution network to temporally limit the charging power of EVs.

Summary: In the last 10 years microRNA (miR) research has \"exploded\" and is now part of general education. Much effort has been made to investigate the biogenesis of these short RNAs. However, it is only little known about their physiological role. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is an inducible microRNA, which plays an important role in the regulation of the immune system. It has been shown that miR-155 deficiency leads to a malfunction of the adaptive immune system. These mice cannot establish memory cells as a result of infection. However, it is only little known about the role of miR-155 in the innate immune system. It has been shown that expression of miR-155 positively correlates with the inflammatory status of myeloid cells.

The system change from conventional demand-oriented generation to supply-based consumption raises the question of a participation of private consumers, which played a decisive role in 2011 with a total share of 26% of the demand for electrical energy in Germany. The present paper examines the flexibility of the load of \"private last-consumers\" by means of variable tariffing and their application as a method in the Smart Grid system. In view of the state of research on technical and economic background, the question of integrating private last-consumers into grid operation is answered. To this end, flexible tariffs as well as smart metering are explained as prerequisites, as well as the grid development index (GDI) as a classification of the development stage of a smart grid are introduced.

Increasing environmental problems are the burden that the past has put on the new millennium.

Effective behavioural corrections are linked to the convictions of the individual consumer regarding the results of his actions, the expectations of other and the individual barriers to master.

This work explores the extent to which the reforms of the housing-related services of the so-called disability assistance required in the field of healing education under the term deinstitutionalization can be realized by a change of the organizations addressed. The core of the work is an empirical study on the decentralisation and regionalization of a large and complex institution. The theoretical foundation of the study is based on the deinstitutionalisation of the medical educational discourse and is supplemented and further developed by an institution-sociological perspective of neo-institutionalism. The qualitative study subsequently analyses the structural and substantive facets of the change of the large and complex institution in its interaction. The results thus show the complexity of the change processes, especially in terms of the everyday reality of residents in stationary settings.

Physical hydrogels are currently becoming increasingly interested in the cell substrates, as viscoelasticity or stress relaxation is an important parameter in mechanotransduction, which has been neglected so far. In this work, multi-functional polyurethanes have been designed, which form physical hydrogels via a novel geling mechanism. In water, the anionic polyurethanes spontaneously form aggregates, which are held in solution by electrostatic rejection. A fast geling can be achieved from here by charge shielding, which leads to aggregation and a network is formed. This can be done by adding different acids or salts, so that both acidic (pH 4-5) and pH neutral hydrogels can be obtained. While conventional hydrogels on polyurethane basis are usually produced by toxic isocyanate-containing prepolymers, the physical geling mechanism described here is suitable for use in sensitive environments.
