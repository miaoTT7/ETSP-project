Since the beginning of the 19th century quantitative methods have been used in the literary and humanities to describe, analyse and interpret texts. Until the end of the 20th century such approaches were underrepresented, but in the course of the digital humanities they are becoming very important. The aim of the volume is to contextualize quantitative methods in theory, methods and subject-historical terms, but also to examine with a view to the digital present what their results are of importance. In view of the innovative verve of digital humanities, it must not be forgotten that the idea of opposing an interpretative close reading to a descriptive-analytic distant reading (meaning?) is not much younger than the idea of close reading itself. Because counting has by no means become conceivable only by the 'digital revolution' of the humanities. Rather, for about 200 years now, what was determined by the late dilthey as the subject of the understanding and qualitatively oriented humanities, has been declared to be 'measureable'.", "title_en": "Quantitative approaches in the literature and humanities : systematic and historical perspectives"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4001183-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2018", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "de"}}

Since ancient times migration movements have had a special significance for the change of architecture and technology. These can be triggered by wars, political repression, voluntary decisions or economic pressure. Again and again, cultural overburdens, transformation and displacement processes occur, the results of which illustrate the stability or transformation of a society and its building culture. The publication gathers contributions from archaeology, the history of construction and construction technology, the preservation of monuments and the history of art and architecture. In individual studies, the mechanisms that led to the transformation of building as a result of individual and collective immigration are examined across different periods of time.", "title_en": "Migration and Building Culture : Transformation of Building through Individual and Collective Immigration"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4002851-3", "gnd:4059277-7", "gnd:4144204-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1210271893", "year": "2019", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "de"}}

This volume looks at Europe-wide discussions and controversy around 1900.

These included war and peace scenarios, the scientific resonation about a \"new person\", the perspectives of economics and technology, cultural and artistic locational regulations and future designs, the expectations of a new gender order as well as the development of industrial class society. These topics are examined from different locations: from the perspective of social movements as well as from political classes, scientists or professional groups. \"Public opinion\" of the turn of the century thus ranges into various actors and discutants.

The combination of a tightening criminal policy and restrictive social policy, as it is currently staged, has a rather integrated character in its interaction with social marginal groups. In connection with increasing poverty, social exclusion has become an important issue in recent years. An increasing number of long-term unemployed, the precarious living conditions of migrants in the metropolises, the increasing poverty among young people, all this points to social situations which are substantiated by the concept of social exclusion. The logic of such social processes: the less competitive, the socially vulnerable, the less vulnerable and the more economically and socially vulnerable, the greater the risk of social exclusion of morally degraded persons or groups.

With the topic \"Public financial flows and spatial development\" the Academy of Spatial Research and Planning (ARL) addresses questions whose far-reaching and lasting political significance is uncontroversial and whose daily appearance is always in the foreground of public interest. Spatial effects are derived from all fiscal policies, including those which do not have an explicit spatial development policy objective. Nevertheless, the spatial implications of financial policy decisions are often not included in the political decision-making processes and spatial consequences of political decisions are not sufficiently analysed and evaluated systematically. In this context, the present volume offers exemplary studies and regionalized analyses as well as theoretical considerations on the spatial effects of public funding and use in a wide range of current economic and financial policy areas.

'The volume combines 17 contributions from an international conference held at the University of Göttingen from 18-20 June 2015. He raises the question of the manifestations and practices of the sacred in pre-modern courts, whether in buildings, objects or rituals. The focus of a cross-cultural discourse is the post-antique palace with its religious places and zones, but also other forms of cultic tabooization and sanctioning, in which the border between \"profan\" and \"sacral\" is often difficult to determine. The temporal framework ranges from antiquity to the late Middle Ages, the cultural spectrum from Western Europe and Byzantineism to the Islamic courts in Syria and Al-Andalus.'", "title_en": "Palatium Sacrum : Sacredness at the court of the Middle Ages : Places, things, rituals"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4129695-3", "gnd:4178936-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:124477670X; gnd:2024315-7", "year": "2021", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "de"}}

In contrast, it is less present that in the debates of the period around 1900 the economic aspect of the city concept has been of very considerable importance. This connection can be read at Max Weber's work.
