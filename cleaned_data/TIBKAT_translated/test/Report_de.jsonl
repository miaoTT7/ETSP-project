Klappentext: The development of modernity can be described as a development from the directly surrounding spaces to the unlimited distant spaces. While in the early tribal societies a strong bond to the near space can be observed, the modernism leads precisely beyond the alternatively given spaces and opens up new horizons. The complaint about the loss of the community, the local and the tradition finds its starting point here. The present work argues that this bond of the social to the close relations of a systematic confrontation with the space in sociology stood in the way for a long time. In the passage through central sociological theoretical positions and through individual case studies, not only the effects of this privilege of proximity are shown, but also the simultaneousness of deterritorialization and reterritorialization processes, of openings and closures is investigated.", "title_en": "Spaces, places, borders : on the way to a sociology of space"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4048561-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:122658531", "year": "2006", "type": "Report", "language_original": "de"}}

The most pressing problems of an environment oriented towards sustainability are gathered here. The volume is based on a public lecture series organized by the Research Institute for Philosophy Hannover. The focus is on the concept of sustainability, which has been widely and often quite blurredly used since the 1992 Environmental Summit in Rio, for which environmental sciences are of central importance. From a very different perspective, i.e. from renowned experts from various disciplines, it is examined and put to the test. In their texts the authors (biologists, politicians, theologians, philosophers, historians, economists) examine questions, articulate demands, describe conditions. To the current debate a profound title, indispensable for large public libraries.

Around 200 renowned scientists have written the compact, yet well-understood individual contributions. These are each provided with references to further literature.

Introduced into the development of object-oriented C++ applications including web applications. This is addressed to beginners without any prior knowledge. This is possible despite the complexity of C++ programming, as the book is based on the current version of the Borland C++ Builder. The Borland C++ Builder is an easy-to-use development environment for visual development of C++ programs. An earlier version of the Borland C++ Builder is described in detail by D. Abels (BA 1/01). The new edition (1st edition not discussed) is required by the further development of the Borland C++ Builder. Extensions and additions to the prepress concern systematic tests and unit tests, programming logic and program verification as well as object-oriented analysis and design. A focus of the presentation is on a comprehensive reference of the C++ standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2003), where all important language elements are systematically displayed.", "title_en": "C++ with Borland C++Builder 2007 : Introduction to the C++ standard and object-oriented Windows programming"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:7604775-1", "gnd:4193909-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1156684323", "year": "2008", "type": "Report", "language_original": "de"}}

The question is not whether fossil fuels (especially oil) are finally, but how soon the sources will finally disappear. 3 years after his considerable debut \"Eco-Realism\" (BA 2/03), which Gründinger (born 1984) had presented as a senior student, the student of political science and member of Youth for Intergenerational Justice and Sustainability - Europe (YOIS) deals in detail with the explosive energy question. The \"pyroman\" humanity burns itself, had become a threatening trap due to the dependence on the \"black drug oil\" from which they can hardly get rid of. His chant on the fossil-atomic energy supply, the critical analysis of the current energy system and his propagated \"way into an industrial solar age\" (energy revolution) feed out a broad fund of current data and facts from literature, but also secret documents.

Ideally, the reader should already have a little programming experience, even if the surface and the most important language elements of MATLAB are presented in chapters 1 and 2. Chapter 3 explains the object-oriented programming with MATLAB. Here the central concepts are introduced like classes, properties, methods, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphy and handle classes. Chapter 4 contains applications from physics and mechanical engineering. This is intended to deepen the handling of the learned and give further tips for a structured procedure. In conclusion, Chapter 5 provides a command reference and a comparison with other OOP languages. Numerous examples and graphics facilitate and illustrate the handling of MATLAB.
