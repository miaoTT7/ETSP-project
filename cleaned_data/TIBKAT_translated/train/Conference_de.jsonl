The volume gathers impulses on the discourse on these questions, mediates orienting for educational practice and encourages to reflect on the havoc of historical-political learning and the relation of the present as well as on the future tasks of the concentration camps.", "title_en": "History of yesterday for Germans of tomorrow? : the experience of National Socialism and historical-political learning in the (post-)migration society"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4019622-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:103700972X; gnd:1201757894", "year": "2019", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "de"}}

The individual contributions are slightly revised presentations of an IRS workshop, whose aim was to discuss the global and local migration movements in terms of their causes and consequences and to examine them on the basis of selected examples from East Germany. Compared to the normal processes of urban development, the abrupt socio-economic cuts, changes in the power of disposal over resources, the changed living situations of the affected population and the upheaval in the political-administrative system have a lasting impact on the socio-demographic development of the urban regions. The superposition of these various processes creates a multi-layered, often contradictory picture of migration events, which so far only unfailingly merges into a new trend of East German urban development.

In connection with the presentation of a transport network in Norththuringen, the main argument is for improved and tactured public transport services on road and rail with a uniform tariff. The final contribution deals with spatial alternatives in transport. This is mainly about the need for a new (sustainable) planning understanding.The second part focuses on regional and local initiatives. At the beginning, the concept of the plan region Nordthuringen for transport development and location development is presented in regional terms.

The current theoretical approaches of just war, counterconcepts such as the concept of just peace supported and co-formed by the two major churches in Germany, as well as concepts about war and peace in other world religions, are discussed.

On the one hand, the health sector as a whole is becoming increasingly a health economy, where growth and development processes require an accompanying competition order. On the other hand, the internal core of the health sector, the solidarity-funded system of statutory health insurance, is subject to constant pressure for reform.The system of statutory health insurance is subject to the health policy debate despite greater opening clauses in favour of selective contractual options with established doctors and health insurance companies in most cases not to competition law, but to social law or competition law, as is the case with social courts. The question of how competition rules can be developed on the one hand and the guarantee of social security on the other hand dominates the health policy debate.

With the term of the Knowledge Society, time diagnoses emphasize the growing importance of (scientific) knowledge for all areas of social action. A still little researched consequence of this development is the need to communicate knowledge and translate for other fields of action. The volume examines the question of how different actors in the knowledge society manage and shape these communication requirements. In the first part, contributions are made that reconstruct and theoretically locate specific new forms and paradigms of knowledge communication. Here, the focus is on relevant examples from the spectrum of new forms of communication, such as science comics and novels. In the second part, mediated forms of communication are the focus, for example, on the exchange of knowledge on web-based question and answer platforms or YouTube.

In what intensity and scope does the network – not least thanks to artificial intelligence – generate common publics and counter-publics in which individuals as indeed free and equal communicate with each other? To what extent do social media support these desirable spaces of equality and freedom of persons and in which ways political power asymmetries and social exclusions arise in them, too?

In this respect, it is not surprising that the newspaper is also aggressively responding to the recent challenge posed by digital electronic media. In no phase of newspaper history was the dynamics of change as high as can be observed for some years. The functional change to which the newspaper is subjected has various causes: the competition with the media radio and television for an audience whose media use is increasingly characterized by entertainment orientation; the change of reception expectations towards a stronger visualization; and not least the emergence of a parallel medium, the electronic newspaper. In view of this situation, the criticism of how it is currently being expressed in new forms of presentation of the print media is being expressed in the words \"designer journalism\" or \"lego journalism\", at least prematurely.

Terrorism is not a new phenomenon historically. At the latest since the 1970s, its various forms of play pose challenges for the liberal states of Western Europe. They are resisting ever new dimensions of danger not only by increasing security measures in public space (for example with concrete barriers against the abuse of vehicles for the killing of civilian victims); but also in law, \"reinforcement\" takes place. In view of the current, profound changes in the law at national and international level, it is time to stop for an inventory: Do liberal democracies threaten to lose their freedom in view of the terrorist threats and a intensified policy of internal security, which is just constitutive for these states?

The new comes to us in such a way that we can either receive it passively or anticipate it and accordingly actively design it and shape it. Also the existential attitudes we adopt towards the future and the affective evaluations we bring to it have a contradictory character. We can see the coming as fulfilment or threat to us, therefore we expect the future in fear or hope. The present book investigates the future relationship in the horizon of two disciplines, which deal in a special way with the basic conditions of human existence and experience in time: philosophy and psychoanalysis. The contributions gathered in this volume shed light on the phenomenon of expectation in its internal tension and diverging forms, its cultural prerequisites and its existential significance.

Since the 1990s, a pluralization of the research approaches in the subject can be observed, which corresponds with an increasing aesthetic heterogeneity of theatre and the opening of the subject to interdisciplinary dialogue.

It contains the written lectures held at the conference \"Digitalization and Criminal Procedures\" at the University of Leipzig. Experts from science and practice discussed opportunities and challenges of the new technical possibilities: first experiences with the electronic file, the use of electronic evidence or the technical recording of interrogations and main negotiations. The controversial e-evidence regulation and its consequences for investigations in Germany are also taken into consideration. In future, judges can help to access decisions and considerations of other courts for their criminal investigations. And also in the criminal prosecution, digitization is taking hold and raises the question whether prisoners should be allowed to use tablets or mobile phones.

The concept of digitality has only recently become the focus of cultural and spiritual science. It does not correspond to the understanding of digitalization in terms of the development of technologies, the collection and storage of data and the automation of processes. Rather, digitality reflects on cultural and social realities and forms of life that go hand in hand with digitalization and enable it to interact. The aim of the volume is to determine the phenomenon of digitality and to focus on cultural, philosophical, didactic and sociological aspects of life in a digitalised world. The following questions are at the heart of this: What is the relationship between the phenomena \"digitalization\" and \"digitality\"? How do teaching and learning processes in the context of digitalization and digitality change? What challenges, opportunities and problems arise from the digitality of the future of society and universities?

The interplay ranges from the thesis that shadows are holes in light to the inverse idea that they are the representatives of the cosmic darkness remaining on Earth, which are being torn up by light. There are more and more light sources on Earth, so that more and more light and less shadow zones and darkness. In architecture, the transparency of the new buildings and their organization grows. The increased use of glass and other translucent layers as a result of more light raises the question of the significance of shadows. Are shadows a gain - a protection or loss of brightness.

Telecommunications and information technologies represent the challenges of a connected world in the 21st century. Were the revolutions of industry and transport in the 19th and 20th centuries the decisive forces of the urbanization process, the information revolution that began with telephone and fax and now provisionally flows into the Internet is now considered as the most powerful factor of future urban development. Critics of this process state that many functions that previously established the existence of cities are now fulfilled by locationless computer networks. Cities would therefore have been depleted. The city now threatens to disappear completely in virtual space. Scientific findings, however, show that even in the world of cyberspace the old economic principle of agglomeration still has its validity: people still need personal contact to meet each other, to handle business, to exchange information and goods.

The interest in a dialogue between psychoanalysis and neuroscientists is growing strongly in both the scientific community and the media and in the wider public.

The research results of modern neurobiology on trauma are extremely fascinating and promising from a psychoanalytic and psychiatric point of view. However, for neuroscientists too, the rich clinical experiences of psychoanalysts with trauma patients are revealing.

The spatial presence of religion marks their respective social significance.

Spaces thus have a central significance for the transformation of religion since the 1950s, which has been significantly shifted: First, classical religious spaces like churches have been given a different shape; secondly, the church occupied non-church public spaces such as streets and squares; and thirdly, diverse new spaces of religious communication in the media have emerged.

The biogas plant systems in the different regions of Lower Saxony differ primarily from one another by the available or used substrate types. While in the arable region of South Lower Saxony no economic fertiliser is available as a substrate, the utilization of manure from resident livestock farms does not pose a problem for the plants in the processing and mixed region. The plant from the dairy livestock region is characterized by the fact that grass silage is used as a substrate from the grassland that predominates in the region. The availability of alternative energy crops in this region is lower, as the arable areas for the cultivation of livestock feed are proven. The choice of the substrates used has a significant influence on the results of the ecological assessment.

A common starting point is that tension relationship that is evident in the way of speaking from the misinterpretation of purpose: on the one hand, we combine with its violations of rules and normations.

In processes of urban and regional identity formation, references to historical authenticity, for example of preserved monuments and old cities, take a central role. The volume focuses on the significance of the concept of authenticity in various disciplines such as city history, architectural history, preservation of monuments and tourism history. Using German and international examples, the contributions show the ambiguity of authenticity claims and interpret them against the background of social debates about the importance of the past as well as political and economic interests. The context of action is examined by actors in politics and associations, architects and urban planners as well as the city society itself. The focus is on the 20th century with special consideration of the history of the past after 1945.", "title_en": "Built history : historical authenticity in urban areas"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4018406-7", "gnd:4002851-3", "gnd:4011455-7", "gnd:4056723-0", "gnd:4193985-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:103700972X", "year": "2017", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "de"}}

The phenomenon of transformation and tradition of traditional knowledge levels is so striking in almost every epoch of European history as in the hinge phase between antiquity and the Middle Ages. Over a period of great instability, highly complex knowledge corresponding to the difference between late Roman society was transformed, reduced and reorganized. In addition, in the literature field, but also in scientific texts and in the legal corpora, different techniques and strategies of quantitative compression and reduction were used. From the perspective of different disciplines, the contributions of the volume illuminate these diverse reduction processes in Gaul, Spain and Italy from the 4th to the 8th century and in particular examine the question of how to reduce complexity and to shift complexity through the distortion, compilation and selective traditional processes.
