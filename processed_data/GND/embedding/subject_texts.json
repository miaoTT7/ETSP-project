The name \"Coltan\" derives from the Columbit-Tantalite mineral group (Coltan=short form). Columbit itself (according to Römpp) is a niobit and tantalite. Coltan is classified as a conflict mineral. Coltan mining in the Congo mainly focuses on the Kivusee region in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since 2004 internationally known by the struggles for exploitation rights between Rwanda and Congo. Coltan is a raw material necessary for computer and mobile phone industry.",

  "Theoretical and physical chemistry. The Persistent Radical Effect (PRE) is a general principle that explains the highly selective formation of the cross coupling product between two radicals, if one is long-lived (persistent) and the other is short-lived (transient) and both are formed in equal quantities. The initial build-up of an excess of persistent radicals is done by termination reactions between transient radicals. This leads to the fact that practically only the cross coupling runs as the only reaction path.",

  "Mathematics. A Lie algebraid is a vector bundle A (smooth, real and finite dimensional unless otherwise specified), the module of sections of which has a Lie algebra structure over R which interacts with the module structure via a Leibniz rule with respect to a bracket-preserving vector bundle map (the anchor) from A to the tangent bundle of the base. The term Lie algebraid was introduced in 1966 by Pradines. There is an alternative usage in algebraic geometry; but this rare causes confusion.",

Ziel der Zusammenstellung der Software in einem Paket ist es, eine besonders einfache Installation zu erreichen. Für Windows-Systeme gibt es eine Version mit Installationsroutine, für die anderen unterstützten Betriebssysteme (s.u.) immerhin eine Version mit ausführlicher Installationsanleitung. Mit wenigen Mausklicks erhält man Server-Werkzeuge, die alleine teilweise recht lange Konfigurationszeiten benötigen würde.",

As with diesel engines, the fuel is exposed to high temperature, which leads to ignition. However, the fuel is not injected in the same way as the diesel engine, but a homogeneous fuel-air mixture is produced during the inlet phase.",

Fish fins behave unexpectedly under lateral pressure: if, for example, you press the finger slightly against the tail fin of a trout, it does not pinch away as expected in the direction of pressure, but rather the fin moves towards the finger against the direction of pressure. This effect is called the Fin Ray Effect. The patented fin jet effect is based on the structure of the individual fin beams. These consist of two fixed struts each, which converge at the top and are firmly attached there. The two struts form a sharp-angled triangle. Between the two bend-elastic flanks there are cross struts, which keep the flanks at a distance and enable elastic movements. This function reversal with lateral force action is the basis of many high-tech solutions.",
