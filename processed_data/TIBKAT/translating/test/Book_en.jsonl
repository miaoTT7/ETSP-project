Concerned with various aspects of language in mathematics education, this book aims to reveal some of the ambiguities and complexities in the way language is used in the mathematics curriculum. It aims to present current perspectives and review key issues in mathematics education.Knowledge is transmitted, explored and advanced via language face-to-face, in printed texts, and in other media. Children and their teachers write, read, talk and listen mathematics. Mathematics education begins and proceeds in language, it advances or stumbles because of language, and its outcomes are often assessed in language. \"Language and Mathematical Educuation\" presents current perspectives and reviews the key issues. It brings together in one volume work from researchers concerned with various aspects of language in mathematics education. Each contributor provides an account of their research and draws out the practical implications in terms which will inform and guide teachers. Following the introductory section there are sections exploring: language and early experiences of number; language and meanings in mathematics education; word problems; the uses of discussion; language, mathematics and disability; and cross-linguistic issues. This book examines how language plays significant and problematic roles in mathematics education, reveals some of the ambiguities and complexities in the way language is used in the mathematics curriculum; and will be a useful resource for all mathematics educators.", "title_en": "Language in mathematical education : research and practice"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4037944-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "1991", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

An overview of neurotechnology, the engineering of robots based on animals and animal behavior.The goal of neurotechnology is to confer the performance advantages of animal systems on robotic machines.

The engineering of these robots requires a thorough understanding of the biological systems on which they are based, at both the biomechanical and physiological levels.This book provides an in-depth overview of the field. The areas covered include myomorphic actuators, which mimic muscle action; neuromorphic sensors, which, like animal sensors, represent sensory modalities such as light, pressure, and motion in a labeled-line code; biomimetic controllers, based on the relatively simple control systems of invertebrate animals; and the autonomous behaviors that are based on an animal's selection of behaviors from a species-specific behavioral \"library.\" The ultimate goal is to develop a truly autonomous robot, one able to navigate and interact with its environment solely on the basis of sensory feedback without prompting from a human operator", "title_en": "Neurotechnology for biomimetic robots"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4261462-4", "gnd:4193016-2", "gnd:4006888-2", "gnd:4226127-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2002", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Hungary and Poland have been heavily criticised for some time now because they pursue an ‘illiberal’ form of democracy and, in doing so, violate the principles at the heart of the EU. The combination of the right-wing populism prevalent in these countries and their tendency towards illiberal democracy conveys stark Euroscepticism. The author of this book has been working as a university lecturer of political economics in Hungary since 2012. This book collates a selection of essays and lectures in which he examines the significance of autonomous institutions for a free democracy, the EU’s problems with identification and legitimation, and Francis Fukuyama’s claim that history proves there is no better solution for society than to combine a constitutional democracy with a liberal economic system.The contributions collected in this book offer a nuanced perspective on the attitudes of central and southeast European countries, while also stressing the dangers that ‘illiberal’ democracies pose. Ungarn und Polen stehen seit einiger Zeit im Zentrum der Kritik, weil sie „eine Demokratie ohne Attribute“ (Viktor Orbán) anstreben und sich damit gegen die Grundsätze der EU stellen. Die Tendenz zur illiberalen Demokratie paart sich mit dem Populismus und greift europaskeptische Töne auf. Der Verfasser ist seit 2012 in Ungarn als Hochschullehrer für politische Ökonomie tätig und beschäftigt sich in seiner Sammlung von Aufsätzen und Vorträgen mit der Bedeutung autonomer Institutionen für eine freiheitliche Demokratie, mit den Identifikations- und Legitimationsproblemen der EU sowie mit der Behauptung von Francis Fukuyama, wonach die Geschichte belege, dass es keine bessere Lösung für die Gesellschaft gäbe als die Verknüpfung einer rechtsstaatlichen Demokratie mit einer liberalen Wirtschaftsordnung .Die im Buch zusammengefassten Beiträge bieten eine differenzierte Sicht zur Haltung mittel- und südosteuropäischer Länder, heben aber zugleich die Gefahr hervor, die von „einer Demokratie ohne Attribute“ ausgeht.", "title_en": "Die gefährdete Demokratie : illiberale Demokratie - Populismus - Europaskepsis"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4033203-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:120407353", "year": "2017", "type": "Book", "language_original": "de"}}

Philipp Rode draws on empirical evidence from London and Berlin to examine how urban policymakers, professionals and stakeholders have worked across disciplinary silos, geographic scales and different time horizons since the early 1990s. The key mechanisms for integrated urban governance which enable more compact growth are identified by focusing on the underlying institutional arrangements that have connected strategic urban planning, city design and transport policy in the two case study cities. These include a hybrid model of hierarchical and network governance, the effectiveness of continuous adjustment over disruptive, one-off 'integration fixes' and the prioritisation of certain links between sectoral policy and geographic scales over others. With an interdisciplinary approach connecting urban studies and planning with political science, public administration and organisational studies, this book will be of interest to academics and students in those disciplines, as well as urban practitioners and the applied/policy research community\"--Page 4 of cover", "title_en": "Governing compact cities : how to connect planning, design and transport"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4056783-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:116944704X", "year": "2018", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The potential of diasporas as a source of economic and social development in origin countries and whether diasporas could help foster development depend on their characteristics, such as size, composition, skill levels and degree of concentration, but also on the degree of integration into the destination countries and the economic, political and social environment in origin countries. Governments of origin and destination countries can indeed facilitate the involvement of diasporas, by supporting networks, by facilitating communication channels with the country of origin, by creating an enabling environment, or – more directly – by easing skill mobility and use. In this regard, the capacity to characterise the profile of diasporas is instrumental.

A potentially troubling aspect of modern vehicle design - some would argue - is a trend towards isolating the driver and reducing vehicle feedback, usually in the name of comfort and refinement but increasingly because of automation. There can be little doubt cars have become more civilised over the years yet, despite this, the consequences on driver behaviour remain to a large extent anecdotal. Readers of this book will have heard such anecdotes for themselves. They usually take the form of drivers of a certain age recalling their first cars from the 1970's or 80's, in which \"doing 70mph really felt like it\". The question is whether such anecdotes actually reflect a bigger, more significant issue that could be better understood? Related questions have been explored in other domains such as aviation, where the change to 'fly-by-wire', for example, did indeed bring about some occasionally serious performance issues which were not anticipated. Despite some clear parallels automotive systems have been left relatively unexamined.

Many items we use in our daily lives-the traffic signals, motion sensors, fingerprint readers, cell phone cameras, bar code scanners, and DVD players-rely upon plastic optical systems to perform. Consequently, there is a growing need for individuals who are knowledgeable in the design, development, and production of such systems. This book provides an overview of the design of plastic optical systems and is structured along the lines of a typical development project. Following a brief background discussion, the advantages and disadvantages of plastic optics are considered. Next, the available materials and their properties are described, as well as the issues of material selection and specification. Various manufacturing methods are reviewed, followed by a chapter on design guidelines, leading into several design examples. Following the examples, the prototyping and testing of a design is covered. Finally, bringing the design to production is discussed. Several groups will benefit from the material presented, including optical engineers, technical managers, and engineers of other disciplines who need to design and develop plastic optical systems but lack the knowledge or training to do so. With the help of this book, readers should understand the benefits and limitations of plastic optical systems and be able to determine if this technology is appropriate for their applications.

In standard quantum mechanics, it is postulated that when the wave function of a quantum system is measured, it no longer follows the Schrödinger equation, but instantaneously and randomly collapses to one of the wave functions that correspond to definite measurement results. However, why and how a definite measurement result appears is unknown. A promising solution to this problem are collapse theories in which the collapse of the wave function is spontaneous and dynamical. Chapters written by distinguished physicists and philosophers of physics discuss the origin and implications of wave-function collapse, the controversies around collapse models and their ontologies, and new arguments for the reality of wave function collapse.

Materials have played a revolutionary role in the development of the modern technological age, and their various applications have made our lives increasingly comfortable here on our home, the beautiful blue planet Earth. With the application of heat, pyroelectric materials produce electric current, qualifying them for use in uncooled infrared detectors. Infrared detectors are encountered in a vast number of applications in both war and peace - many of their uses are routine to us in everyday life. With the advent of new technologies, thermal sensing and imaging have become useful diagnostic tools for medical, industrial, and military applications. In medicine, infrared thermal imaging is applied to detect vascular disorders and arthritic rheumatisms as well as to monitor muscular performances and make preclinical diagnoses of breast cancer. Recently, these materials have been used in nuclear particle generation, and their usefulness in energy harvesting is currently under exploration. This monograph contains comprehensive cutting-edge information on pyroelectric materials and their preparation, properties, and applications, such as uncooled wideband infrared detectors, particle generators, and ambient energy harvesters. The complete lifecycle of a pyroelectric material is presented here for readers - from the theory of operation, to structure, and processing and applications - providing a cohesive overview of all of the necessary concepts, including theoretical background and current developments in the field of pyroelectric devices.

Lignin is one of the most abundant plant-derived feedstock on earth and qualifies as a renewable material. However, lignin is widely recognized as waste byproduct of the cellulosic ethanol and pulp and paper industry. How to properly modify lignin and develop it into functional polymers is a huge challenge, but an attractive research topic in both industry and academia. This book brings together leading engineering approaches to address the challenges of lignin valorization. It presents the chemistry and properties of different types of lignin, and explores the cutting-edge approaches of lignin modifications. Unlike any existing texts, this book not only summarizes the traditional ways of using lignin, but also presents various potential applications of lignin materials together with advanced processing techniques. The basis of lignin (its chemistry, types and properties) is described, as are different approaches to modify it. The features of lignin and its copolymers are explored and aligned with their potential applications.

The author examines highway finance from the perspective of individual jurisdictions and travellers, and considers their interactions rather than specifying a single optimal solution. Congestion pricing has long been a goal of transportation economists, who believe it will result in a more efficient use of resources. Levinson argues that if the governance were to become more decentralized, and collection costs continue to drop, tolls could return to prominence as the preferred means of financing roads for both local and intercity travel.

Almost 230 000 people died. In response, governments in Asia and the broader international community announced large aid programs. The resulting assistance effort was one of the largest humanitarian programs ever organized in the developing world. This book discusses the lessons of the aid effort for disaster protection policy in developing countries. -- How effective was the aid? What lessons can be learnt about how to respond when disasters strike in poor countries? This insightful book addresses these questions drawing on three themes of current development policy: international aid policy; human security and the poor; and approaches to disaster risk reduction. The most important lesson is the need to ‘go local’ in building up resilience at the grassroots level in poor countries in Asia. Other lessons include the need for better cooperation between the international community and local and national organizations as well as the need to ensure that adequate funding is provided to support disaster protection and post-disaster recovery programs while taking into account cost inflation associated with large-scale reconstruction efforts.", "title_en": "The Asian tsunami : aid and reconstruction after a disaster"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4261303-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:171605799; gnd:12352539X; gnd:143064460; gnd:170366979; gnd:17153056X", "year": "2010", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

'This book is a welcome and timely analysis of how global economic and financial powerhouses in Asia also aim to become global cultural cities. It critically examines the tension between top-down policies implemented by strong states to boost urban culture, which are typically focused on the hardware of iconic venues, museums, and opera houses mostly designed by famous western architects, and the need for freedom to enable more organic cultural initiatives rooted in local practices.'

Kloosterman, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands). -- 'This book not only establishes the importance of cultural projects in crafting Asia's new global cities, it offers the first systematic comparison of both governmental plans and artists' actions in major urban sites from Beijing to Singapore.

These questions have become particularly relevant since the outbreak of the debt crises in the Eurozone and the Brexit referendum. The author critically subverts theories of European integration and analyses the rise and fall of federations, empires and states in a comparative perspective. The most promising theory presented here indicates that Brexit is not likely to be followed by other member states leaving the EU.

Don’t allow yourself to be forced into one paradigm or the other, but combine both approaches by using the Document Store. MySQL 8 was designed from the beginning to bridge the gap between NoSQL and SQL. Oracle recognizes that many solutions need the capabilities of both. More specifically, developers need to store objects as loose collections of schema-less documents, but those same developers also need the ability to run structured queries on their data. With MySQL 8, you can do both! Introducing the MySQL 8 Document Store presents new tools and features that make creating a hybrid database solution far easier than ever before. This book covers the vitally important MySQL Document Store, the new X Protocol for developing applications, and a new client shell called the MySQL Shell.

Megastructure proposals by the Japanese Metabolism group are commonly identified with the concept of utopia. Beyond this partial understanding, the author suggests that rather than being merely utopian, the Megastructure of Metabolism represents a uniquely amalgam genre: the myth camouflaged as utopia. Although its Megastructure seemingly describes a desirable future condition as utopia does, it also comprises certain cultural images rooted in the collective (un)conscious of Japanese people, in accordance with the general interpretation of myth. The primary narrative of the book thus follows the gradual unfolding of the myth-like characteristics of its Megastructure. Myth is dealt here as an interdisciplinary subject in line with contemporary myth theories. After expounding the mechanism underlying the growing demand for a new myth in architecture (the origin of the myth), Part I discovers the formal characteristics of the Megastructure of Metabolism to give a hint of the real intention behind it. Based on this, Part II is a reexamination of their design methods, which aims to clarify the function of the myth and to suggest the meaning behind it. Finally, Part III deals with the subject matter of the myth by disclosing the meaning unfolding in the story, and suggests a new reading of Metabolism's urban theory: as an attempt to reconsider the traditional Japanese space concept", "title_en": "Beyond utopia : Japanese metabolism architecture and the birth of mythopia"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4169554-9", "gnd:4056795-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:132541661", "year": "2018", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

A greater impetus has emerged in recent years for larger corporations to assume a pivotal role in framing the issues of climate change-focused policy, ensuring environmental sustainability across the value chain and in leading by example with best implementation practices. This collection of leading-edge research addresses the fast-evolving role of multinational enterprises as agents of change in standard development and as diffusers of innovation in solving sustainability problems. CSR and Climate Change Implications for Multinational Enterprises presents a unique lens to address generic issues and how they manifest and find resolution in various industry sectors, from the perspective of different disciplines ranging from logistics to finance to ethics. Contributors from the United States, Europe and emerging economies offer contrasting views on how corporate social governance best addresses the sustainability implications of climate change, seeking innovative ways to incorporate environmental stewardship in policy design and operational firm-level concerns.

This book discusses group theory investigations of zincblende and wurtzite semiconductors under symmetry-breaking conditions. The text presents the group theory elements required to develop a multitude of symmetry-breaking problems, giving scientists a fast track to bypass the need for recalculating electronic states. The text is not only a valuable resource for speeding up calculations but also illustrates the construction of effective Hamiltonians for a chosen set of electronic states in crystalline semiconductors. Since Hamiltonians have to be invariant under the transformations of the point group, the crystal symmetry determines the multiplet structure of these states in the presence of spin-orbit, crystal-field, or exchange interactions. Symmetry-breaking leads to additional coupling of the states, resulting in shifts and/or splittings of the multiplets. Such interactions may be intrinsic, as in the case of the quasi-particle dispersion, or extrinsic, induced by magnetic, electric, or strain fields. Using a power expansion of the perturbations these interaction terms can be determined in their parameterized form in a unique way. The hierarchic structure of this invariant development allows to estimate the importance of particular symmetry-breaking effects in the Hamiltonian. A number of selected experimental curves are included to illustrate the symmetry-based discussions, which are especially important in optical spectroscopy.

Markov processes -- Stochastic Differential Equations and Martingale Problems -- Stochastic Filtering -- Static Markov Bridges and Enlargement of Filtrations -- Dynamic Bridges -- Financial markets with informational asymmetries and equilibrium -- Kyle-Back model with dynamic information: no default case -- Appendix A This book undertakes a detailed construction of Dynamic Markov Bridges using a combination of theory and real-world applications to drive home important concepts and methodologies. In Part I, theory is developed using tools from stochastic filtering, partial differential equations, Markov processes, and their interplay. Part II is devoted to the applications of the theory developed in Part I to asymmetric information models among financial agents, which include a strategic risk-neutral insider who possesses a private signal concerning the future value of the traded asset, non-strategic noise traders, and competitive risk-neutral market makers. A thorough analysis of optimality conditions for risk-neutral insiders is provided and the implications on equilibrium of non-Gaussian extensions are discussed. A Markov bridge, first considered by Paul Lévy in the context of Brownian motion, is a mathematical system that undergoes changes in value from one state to another when the initial and final states are fixed. Markov bridges have many applications as stochastic models of real-world processes, especially within the areas of Economics and Finance. The construction of a Dynamic Markov Bridge, a useful extension of Markov bridge theory, addresses several important questions concerning how financial markets function, among them: how the presence of an insider trader impacts market efficiency; how insider trading on financial markets can be detected; how information assimilates in market prices; and the optimal pricing policy of a particular market maker.

This book covers mathematical foundations and methods for the computerized analysis of shapes, providing the requisite background in geometry and functional analysis and introducing various algorithms and approaches to shape modeling, with a special focus on the interesting connections between shapes and their transformations by diffeomorphisms. A direct application is to computational anatomy, for which techniques such as large‒deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping and metamorphosis, among others, are presented. The appendices detail a series of classical topics (Hilbert spaces, differential equations, Riemannian manifolds, optimal control). The intended audience is applied mathematicians and mathematically inclined engineers interested in the topic of shape analysis and its possible applications in computer vision or medical imaging. The first part can be used for an advanced undergraduate course on differential geometry with a focus on applications while the later chapters are suitable for a graduate course on shape analysis through the action of diffeomorphisms.

This study examines the impact of the financial crisis on public sector labour relations in four countries, as a result of which marked differences become apparent. After the crisis, the public sectors in the UK and Spain were subject to pronounced austerity measures, which had a massive impact on earnings and employment conditions as well as on the recognition and the rights of employees and trade unions. The crisis impacted differently on Sweden and Germany, however. Employment conditions had already deteriorated in Germany before the crisis, and since then earnings have been increasing. Despite all the procedural differences, the retrenchment of public services and the weakening of labour rights reveal themselves to be constant political projects.This study was conducted by an international and interdisciplinary team of sociologists, political scientists and historians at the Research Institute for Work, Technology and Culture (F.A.T.K.).

Ferroics comprise a range of materials classes with functionalities such as magnetism, polarization, and orbital degrees of freedom and strain. Frustration, due to geometrical constraints, and disorder, due to chemical and/or structural inhomogeneities, can lead to glassy behavior, which has either been directly observed or inferred in a range of materials classes from model systems such as artificial spin ice, shape memory alloys, and ferroelectrics to electronically functional materials such as manganites. Interesting and unusual properties are found to be associated with these glasses and have potential for novel applications. Just as in prototypical spin glass and structural glasses, the elements of frustration and disorder lead to non-ergodocity, history dependence, frequency dependent relaxation behavior, and the presence of inhomogeneous nano clusters or domains. In addition, there are new states of matter, such as spin ice; however, it is still an open question as to whether these systems belong to the same family or universality class. The purpose of this work is to collect in a single volume the range of materials systems with differing functionalities that show many of the common characteristics of geometrical frustration, where interacting degrees of freedom do not fit in a lattice or medium, and glassy behavior is accompanied by additional presence of disorder. The chapters are written by experts in their fields and span experiment and theory, as well as simulations.

Douglas Kammen explores this pattern in Three Centuries of Conflict in East Timor, studying that region's tragic past, focusing on the small district of Maubara. Once a small but powerful kingdom embedded in long-distance networks of trade, over the course of three centuries the people of Maubara experienced benevolent but precarious Dutch suzerainty, Portuguese colonialism punctuated by multiple uprisings and destructive campaigns of pacification, Japanese military rule, and years of brutal Indonesian occupation. In 1999 Maubara was the site of particularly severe violence before and after the UN-sponsored referendum that finally led to the restoration of East Timor's independence. Beginning with the mystery of paired murders during East Timor's failed decolonization in 1975 and the final flurry of state-sponsored violence in 1999, Kammen combines an archival trail and rich oral interviews to reconstruct the history of the leading families of Maubara from 1712 until 2012. Kammen illuminates how recurrent episodes of mass violence shaped alliances and enmities within Maubara as well as with supra-local actors, and how those legacies have influenced efforts to address human rights violations, post-conflict reconstruction, and the relationship between local experience and the identification with the East Timorese nation. The questions posed in Three Centuries of Conflict in East Timor about recurring violence and local narratives apply to many other places besides East Timor--from the Caucasus to central Africa, and from the Balkans to China--where mass violence keeps recurring\"-- Introduction : situating recurrent mass violenceContested origins -- Maubara and the Dutch East India Company -- Vassalage and violence, 1861-1887 -- The uprising and devastation of 1893 -- High colonialism and new forms of oppression, 1894-1974 -- The end of empire and the Indonesian occupation, 1974-1998 -- Serious crimes and the politics of the past, 1999-2012.", "title_en": "Three centuries of conflict in East Timor"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4138921-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1044279915", "year": "2015", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The NACTO Urban Street Design Guide shows how streets of every size can be reimagined and reoriented to prioritize safe driving and transit, biking, walking, and public activity. Unlike older, more conservative engineering manuals, this design guide emphasizes the core principle that urban streets are public places and have a larger role to play in communities than solely being conduits for traffic. The well-illustrated guide offers blueprints of street design from multiple perspectives, from the birds eye view to granular details. Case studies from around the country clearly show how to implement best practices, as well as provide guidance for customizing design applications to a citys unique needs. Urban Street Design Guide outlines five goals and tenets of world-class street design: Streets are public spaces. Streets play a much larger role in the public life of cities and communities than just thoroughfares for traffic. Great streets are great for business. Well-designed streets generate higher revenues for businesses and higher values for homeowners. Design for safety. Traffic engineers can and should design streets where people walking, parking, shopping, bicycling, working, and driving can cross paths safely. Streets can be changed. Transportation engineers can work flexibly within the building envelope of a street. Many city streets were created in a different era and need to be reconfigured to meet new needs. Act now! Implement projects quickly using temporary materials to help inform public decision making. Elaborating on these fundamental principles, the guide offers substantive direction for cities seeking to improve street design to create more inclusive, multi-modal urban environments.

Beginning in the first century CE, the universal claims of Hellenistic and Roman imperialism began to be challenged by the growing role of Christianity in shaping the primary allegiances and identities of citizens. An international team of scholars considers the extent of urban transformation, and with it, of cultural and civic identity, as practices and institutions associated with the city-state came to be replaced by those of the Christian community. The twelve essays gathered here develop an innovative research agenda by asking new questions: What was the effect on political ideology and civic identity of the transition from the city culture of the ancient world to the ruralized systems of the middle ages?

Nearly fifty generous selections include seminal contributions from Howard, Le Corbusier, Lynch and Jacobs to more recent writings by Hiller, Koolhaas and Sorkin. Following the widespread success of the first wdition of the Urban Design Reader, this updated edition continues to provide the most important historical material of the urban design field, but also introduces new topics and selections that address the myriad challenges facing designers today. The six part structure of the second edition guides the reader through the history, theory and practice of urban design. The reader is initially introduced to those classic writings that provide the historical precedents for city-making into the twentieth Century. Section two introduces the voices and ideas that were instrumental in establishing the foundations of the urban design field from the late 1950s up to the mid 1990s. These authors present a critical reading of the design professions and offer an alternative urban design agenda focused on vital and lively places. The authors in section three provide a range of urban design rationales and strategies for reinforcing local physical identity and the creation of memorable places. These selections are largely describing the outcomes of mid-century urban design and voicing concerns over the placeless quality of contemporary urbanism. The fourth part of the Reader explores key issues in urban design and development. Ideas about sprawl, density, community health, public space and everyday life are the primary focus here. Several new selections in this part of the book also highlight important international development trends in the Middle East and China. Section five presents environmental challenges faced by the built environment professions today, including recent material on landscape urbanism, sustainability, and urban resiliency. The final section examines professional practice and current debates in the field: where urban designers work, what they do, their roles, their fields of knowledge and their educational development. The section concludes with several position pieces and debates on the future of urban design practice. This book provides an essential resource for students and practitioners of urban design, drawing together important but widely dispersed writings. Section and selection introductions are provided to assist readers in understanding the context of the material, summary messages, impacts of the writing, and how they fit into the larger picture of the urban design field. \"--", "title_en": "The urban design reader"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4077804-6", "gnd:4056754-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2013", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

At the same time the public around the globe is mostly apathetic.

Here, despite an effective right-wing campaign to discredit climate science (Oreskes and Conway 2010), surveys now show that a majority of people believe that climate change is happening and needs to be addressed, including, now, a majority of Republicans (Maibach et al 2013).

Topics range from modern classicism, American housing, gardens, and New York City to the work of Norman Foster, Louis Kahn, Charles Moore, and Robert Moses.

In the context of globalisation and demographic change, the internationalisation of society is becoming increasingly important. In this anthology, awareness is raised for this topic. Its first part deals with the “spatial construction through migrants”, focusing on the culturally differentiated construction of spaces and landscapes from a theoretical point of view. From a social perspective, the shifts in such needs/requirements and values that people tie to different parts of their spatial environment are of particular interest. For example, identity constructions underlie a growing erosion process due to globalisation processes, as regards the understanding of space and landscape as well as their acquisition. Thus, the different levels of spatial planning are confronted with further differentiated demands in terms of space and landscape, implying major challenges for planners. Based on different case studies, the anthology’s second part “migration and specific spaces” follows these theoretical considerations and reflects spatial demands of migrants and their potential of internationalisation. The selected case studies mainly deal with rural areas as well as the internationalisation in those cities which has not attracted academic attention until now. At first, the focus is on the investigation of spatial acquisitions and demands of US-American, Muslim and Turkish migrants. Then, the housing situation of migrants is analysed, including the cross-border commuters at the German-Luxembourgish border. The following part is devoted to the potential which can be generated by the increasing internationalisation of the society. This is done on the one hand with a theoretical example of identity, home as well as inclusion and exclusion. On the other hand identities and self-attributions of repatriates from former Soviet Union in Rhineland-Palatinate are discussed. The conclusion, based on the different articles of this volume, discusses recommendations for the future spatial development that arise in the course of internationalisation of society. Die Internationalisierung der Gesellschaft gewinnt im Zuge der Globalisierung sowie des demographischen Wandels zunehmend an Bedeutung, weshalb der vorliegende Sammelband für dieses Thema sensibilisieren möchte. So wird in einem ersten Teil der Themenbereich \"Raumkonstruktionen durch Migrantinnen und Migranten\" behandelt, der sich auf theoretischer Ebene mit der kulturell differenzierten Konstruktion von Räumen und Landschaften auseinandersetzt. Aus gesellschaftlicher Sicht sind vor allem Verschiebungen solcher Bedarfe/Anforderungen und Werte von Interesse, die Menschen an verschiedene Teile ihrer räumlichen Umgebung knüpfen. So unterliegen Identitätskonstrukte beispielsweise vor dem Hintergrund der Globalisierung einem zunehmenden Erosionsprozess, der auch die Verständnisse von Raum und Landschaft, aber auch deren Aneignung betrifft. Auf diese Weise werden die unterschiedlichen Ebenen der räumlichen Planung mit weiter differenzierten Ansprüchen an Raum und Landschaft konfrontiert, was sie vor große Herausforderungen stellt. An die theoretische Betrachtung schließt sich der zweite Themenbereich \"Migration und spezifische Räume\" an, der anhand von unterschiedlichen Fallstudien den Raumanspruch von Migrantinnen und Migranten sowie die Potenziale der Internationalisierung aufzeigt. Die ausgewählten Fallbeispiele beschäftigen sich vor allem mit den ländlichen Räumen sowie der Internationalisierung in bisher weniger im Fokus der Wissenschaft stehenden Städten. Dabei werden zunächst Raumaneignung und Raumansprüche US-amerikanischer, muslimischer und türkischer Migrantinnen und Migranten untersucht. Danach steht die Wohnsituation der Migrantinnen und Migranten im Zentrum, wobei auch auf die Grenzgänger im deutsch-luxemburgischen Grenzraum eingegangen wird. Der folgende Teil widmet sich den Potenzialen, die mit der zunehmenden Internationalisierung der Gesellschaft einhergehen können. Dies geschieht zum einen theoretisch am Beispiel von Identität, Heimat sowie In- und Exklusion. Zum anderen werden beispielhaft Identitäten und Selbstzuschreibungen von (Spät-)Aussiedlern in Rheinland-Pfalz thematisiert. Abschließend werden aus den einzelnen Beiträgen Handlungsempfehlungen abgeleitet und diskutiert, die sich im Zuge der Internationalisierung der Gesellschaft für die zukünftige Raumentwicklung ergeben.", "title_en": "Internationalisierung der Gesellschaft und die Auswirkungen auf die Raumentwicklung : Beispiele aus Hessen, Rheinland-Pfalz und dem Saarland"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4314726-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:37457-X", "year": "2015", "type": "Book", "language_original": "de"}}

The main objective of this book is to provide a practical guide to business and IT leaders who want to improve IT capability to better serve the business. By this, we mean the ability for IT teams to improve the pace at which software applications can be delivered, not just on one Agile pilot project but on all IT projects. But there lies the difficulty for IT management to make the leap from doing Agile or Kanban (Lean) on one project to an IT-wide effort, which requires much more than just deploying some Agile techniques to a few people. Likewise, rather than blindly deploy Agile to the entire IT organization in a one-size-fits-all approach, we also show in this book how IT and business management can work together to determine business goals that can drive this IT-wide undertaking. IT improvement may also require leverage of Kanban (Lean), rather than of Agile alone, to improve it's ability to deliver better and faster applications on a large scale. While we make no claim that what we mention in this book is the best or the only way to introduce change programs into a company, everything in this book comes from our experience in software project management and software delivery in the trenches within companies of different sizes. To make things easier for the busy IT leader and executive, we have constructed and included in this book a few case studies, with the intent to illustrate ideas or principles. All resemblance to a specific, real-life event or character is, therefore, purely coincidental. It is, as always, up to the readers to devise approaches and ideas that will make the most sense in their specific situation. K15472.indb 19 6/15/12 2:10 PM xx ?

The Power of Place explores the nature of power--the power of kings, emperors, and popes--through the places that these rulers created or developed, including palaces, cities, landscapes, holy places, inauguration sites, and burial places. Ranging across all of Europe from the first to the sixteenth centuries--from Prague and Seville to Palermo and the Oslo Fjord--David Rollason examines how these places conveyed messages of power and what those messages were. Rollason draws on the latest research in a range of disciplines--principally archaeology, and the histories of art, architecture, and landscape, as well as historical and literary studies--to investigate what the power of rulers consisted of. Was their power based on impersonal bureaucratic mechanisms, on personal relationships between rulers and subjects, or on strong beliefs in the quasi-divine status of rulers? How did impressive edifices support and emphasize these practices of power? Rollason takes readers to spectacular sites, including the remarkable remains of the tenth-century city of Madinat al-Zahra near Cordoba, the remarkably preserved palace-church of the emperor Charlemagne in Aachen, and the soaring shrine-church of the Saint-Chapelle of King Louis IX.

The information age owes its existence to a little-known but crucial development, the theoretical study of logic and the foundations of mathematics. The Great Formal Machinery Works draws on original sources and rare archival materials to trace the history of the theories of deduction and computation that laid the logical foundations for the digital revolution. Jan von Plato examines the contributions of figures such as Aristotle; the nineteenth-century German polymath Hermann Grassmann; George Boole, whose Boolean logic would prove essential to programming languages and computing; Ernst Schröder, best known for his work on algebraic logic; and Giuseppe Peano, cofounder of mathematical logic. Von Plato shows how the idea of a formal proof in mathematics emerged gradually in the second half of the nineteenth century, hand in hand with the notion of a formal process of computation. A turning point was reached by 1930, when Kurt Gödel conceived his celebrated incompleteness theorems. They were an enormous boost to the study of formal languages and computability, which were brought to perfection by the end of the 1930s with precise theories of formal languages and formal deduction and parallel theories of algorithmic computability.

Alexander von Humboldt, whose marble features greet visitors to Berlin's Humboldt University, was the most admired scientist of his day. But the achievements for which he was most celebrated in his own lifetime were never quite perfect. When he climbed the Chimborazo, at the time believed to be the highest mountain in the world, he did not quite reach the top; he established the existence of the Casiquiare canal, between the great water systems of the Orinoco and the Amazon, but this had been well known to local people. Cosmos, the immense work meant to give a synthetic account of the natural world, was left unfinished. This was not accidental. Humboldt's pursuit of an all-encompassing, immersive approach to science was a way of finding limits: of nature and of the scientist's own self. A Longing for Wide and Unknown Things portrays a scientific life lived in the era of German Romanticism -- a time of radical change, in which new ways of living seemed possible.

During the Augustan age, the division of the city into 14 regions and 265 vici was designed to establish control over the urban space.

Drawing on the testimony of ancient authors such as Tacitus and Suetonius and on material evidence, the volume examines both the circumstances in which these forces intervened and the strategies that they adopted. It also examines the pre-Augustan, Augustan and post-Augustan sense of 'securitas', both as a philosophical and a political concept.

The handbook includes discussions from both right-wing/left-wing political and religiously inspired deradicalisation processes. The handbook is organised into three parts: Definitions, backgrounds and theories; Actors; Regional case studies. This handbook will be of much interest to students of deradicalisation, counter-terrorism, political violence, political extremism, security studies and IR in general\"--", "title_en": "Routledge handbook of deradicalisation and disengagement"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4076308-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2020", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Dealing with Uncertainties proposes and explains a new approach for the analysis of uncertainties.

This perspective has the potential of dealing with the uncertainty of a single data point and of data of a set having differing weights. Both cases cannot be dealt with the inductive approach, which is usually taken. This innovative monograph also fully covers both uncorrelated and correlated uncertainties.

Background on Symplectic Spinors -- Symplectic Connections -- Symplectic Spinor Fields -- Symplectic Dirac Operators -- An Associated Second Order Operator -- The Kähler Case -- Fourier Transform for Symplectic Spinors -- Lie Derivative and Quantization. One of the basic ideas in differential geometry is that the study of analytic properties of certain differential operators acting on sections of vector bundles yields geometric and topological properties of the underlying base manifold. Symplectic spinor fields are sections in an L^2-Hilbert space bundle over a symplectic manifold and symplectic Dirac operators, acting on symplectic spinor fields, are associated to the symplectic manifold in a very natural way. Hence they may be expected to give interesting applications in symplectic geometry and symplectic topology. These symplectic Dirac operators are called Dirac operators, since they are defined in an analogous way as the classical Riemannian Dirac operator known from Riemannian spin geometry. They are called symplectic because they are constructed by use of the symplectic setting of the underlying symplectic manifold. This volume is the first one that gives a systematic and self-contained introduction to the theory of symplectic Dirac operators and reflects the current state of the subject.

Now we know that a giant impact struck the near side with such force that it created the near side megabasin , opening the way for floods of mare and sending vast amounts of ejecta to the far side. The Far Side of the Moon explains this event and also documents the appearance of the features of the far side with beautiful pictures from Lunar Orbiter. As in the previous volume, The Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Near Side of the Moon, the author has taken the original images and cleaned them of system artefacts using modern digital image processing. The best photographic coverage of the far side of the Moon has been the 150 photos taken by the Lunar Orbiter series. The other sources are pictures taken by the Apollo Command Module, which were limited to the equatorial regions, and the Clementine mission, which took pictures at a high sun angle that washed out the topography of the features. Until now, the far side Lunar Orbiter photos have only been available with strong reconstruction lines, but appear here for the first time as complete photographs, unmarred by imaging and processing artefacts. Also, this is the first book to explain in detail how the far side was deeply covered by ejecta from the Near Side Megabasin and modified by later impacts.

In the densely populised Low Countries, with their powerful and self-conscious cities, historical consciousness was expressed in various ways. Cases of regional historiography have been well-studied, but more local instances of historiographical production have remained more or less unnoticed. In ten articles with an extensive introduction, this volume places the local historiography in this region in a European perspective. It brings to the attention new material from a wide variety of cities and sets the standard for future research.0This volume aims at taking the first steps towards a revaluation of urban historiography in Northwest Europe, including rather than excluding texts that do not fit common definitions. It confronts examples from the Low Countries to well-studied cases abroad, in order to develop new approaches to urban historiography in general. In the authors' view, there are no fixed textual formats, social or political categories, or material forms that exclusively define ?the urban chronicle?. Urban historiography in pre-modern Western Europe came in many guises, from the dry and modest historical notes in a guild register, to the elaborate heraldic images in a luxury manuscript made on commission for a patrician family, to the legally founded political narrative of a professional scribe in an official town chronicle. The contributions in this volume attest to the diversity of the ?genre? and look more closely at these texts from a broader, comparative perspective, unrestrained by typologies and genre definitions.

Mathematics is often regarded as the study of calculation, but in fact, mathematics is much more. It combines creativity and logic in order to arrive at abstract truths. This book is intended to illustrate how calculation, creativity, and logic can be combined to solve a range of problems in algebra. Originally conceived as a text for a course for future secondary-school mathematics teachers, this book has developed into one that could serve well in an undergraduate course in abstract algebra or a course designed as an introduction to higher mathematics. Not all topics in a traditional algebra course are covered. Rather, the author focuses on integers, polynomials, their ring structure, and fields, with the aim that students master a small number of serious mathematical ideas. The topics studied should be of interest to all mathematics students and are especially appropriate for future teachers. One nonstandard feature of the book is the small number of theorems for which full proofs are given. Many proofs are left as exercises, and for almost every such exercise a detailed hint or outline of the proof is provided. These exercises form the heart of the text. Unwinding the meaning of the hint or outline can be a significant challenge, and the unwinding process serves as the catalyst for learning.

But what happens to the Universe before the big bang? And would it make any sense at all to ask such a question?

The central mathematical concept in the theory of frictionless markets is a martingale measure. In this, the first monograph devoted to the theory of financial markets with transaction costs, the authors argue that, for financial markets with proportional transaction costs, this concept should be replaced by that of the consistent price system, which is a martingale evolving in the duals to the solvency cones. Three main subjects are considered: 1. The Leland approach to the hedging of contingent claims based on approximate replication. 2. Arbitrage theory for markets with proportional transaction costs based on a geometric approach. 3. The consumption-investment problem analyzed using viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The first part contains recent findings on hedging errors and limit theorems for Leland-type strategies. The rigorous mathematical analysis presented in the book is designed to serve as a platform for further studies. The second part includes a chapter on the arbitrage theory for frictionless markets in discrete time. It is presented as an introduction to the theory of markets with transaction costs, but can also be read independently. The main subjects of the second part are no-arbitrage criteria and hedging theorems for European and American options under transaction costs. In contrast to the classical theory, the value processes are vector-valued and the concept of the martingale measure is replaced by the concept of the consistent price system. Hedging theorems give dual descriptions of the set of initial endowments needed to super-replicate contingent claims. These descriptions are expressed in terms of consistent price systems. This volume provides a detailed study of various new phenomena arising in the presence of market friction in discrete and continuous time. The mathematics needed is a synthesis of ideas from finite-dimensional geometry, geometric functional analysis, and general theory of stochastic processes. The third part deals with the optimal control of portfolios in the presence of market friction using the geometric approach developed in the second part. It contains a study of viscosity solutions of a multidimensional HJB equation. Special attention is paid to the two-asset model, for which the structure of optimal control is described, together with findings on the asymptotic behavior of solutions for vanishing transaction costs.

This book shows how descent methods using such gradients allow a unified treatment of a wide variety of problems in differential equations. For discrete versions of partial differential equations, corresponding Sobolev gradients are seen to be vastly more efficient than ordinary gradients. In fact, descent methods with these gradients generally scale linearly with the number of grid points, in sharp contrast with the use of ordinary gradients. Aside from the first edition of this work, this is the only known account of Sobolev gradients in book form. Most of the applications in this book have emerged since the first edition was published some twelve years ago. What remains of the first edition has been extensively revised. There are a number of plots of results from calculations and a sample MatLab code is included for a simple problem.

At some time we have all gazed through the telescope eyepiece at the magnificent rings and banded globe of Saturn, or seen long shadows reaching across crater floors at the Moon’s terminator - and wondered at the sheer beauty of the sight. It seems almost anachronistic to think of sketching when CCD imaging is available, but astronomical sketching provides an entirely different and deeply personal experience. It means spending time at the eyepiece to really look at what you can see, training your eye to perceive ever greater detail to take the fullest advantage of your telescope's light grasp and resolution. And of course, good astronomical sketches are artwork in themselves, for display and decoration in the home or observatory. Astronomical Sketching is as an easy, step-by-step introduction to sketching celestial objects. It brings together five talented astronomical sketch artists, each of whom has a unique mastery of the media along with the ability to teach their own techniques.

Cosmic Vision, War and Technology -- Brave New Worlds -- Motion, Content and Form -- The Explosive Universe -- The Fullness of Space -- Epilogue - Origins and Destinies Parting the Cosmic Veil describes our gradual awareness of a vast, previously concealed Universe. It is a story of expanding horizons and the discovery of invisible worlds, made possible with new technology and novel telescopes that have broadened our range of perception and sharpened our vision. Spacecraft have carried men to the Moon, and traveled throughout the Solar System, obtaining close-up views that have transformed the moons and planets from moving points of light to fascinating, diverse worlds. Modern technology has also enabled the detection of giant planets around other stars, taking us one step closer to the possible detection of life outside the Earth. Astronomers have used telescopes, operating at the visible wavelengths that we see with our eye, to reveal the true extent of the Milky Way and discover billions of remote galaxies that are rushing away from us in an expanding Universe. Each of these galaxies contains billions of stars wheeling around their massive central hub. Radio waves and X-rays, which lie beyond the range of visual perception, are used to detect a violent Universe, from exploding stars to gamma ray bursts and the Big Bang itself, with the associated discoveries of pulsars, black holes and quasars. Radio astronomers have also shown that the dark spaces between the stars contain vast tracts of cold hydrogen atoms and a host of molecules. Dark invisible matter has been discovered residing outside the shining stars and galaxies, outweighing them all. And a mysterious dark energy has also been found, which fills the nooks and crannies of seemingly empty space. The Cosmos is evolving, participating in ongoing processes of creation, destruction, and re-birth. But even though we are pushing the boundaries of knowledge closer to an understanding of the origins and destinies, of either the Universe or Life, the ultimate answers to these grand questions still lie hidden behind the Cosmic Veil. <This voyage of discovery is presented within universal themes, such as invisibility, motion, content, form, impermanence, violence and emptiness, beginnings and ends. These are topics that concern us all, helping us take the Universe personally, so each chapter begins with the human aspect of some of these themes.

This book is a first sketch of what the overall field of performance could look like as a modern scientific field but not its stylistically differentiated practice, pedagogy, and history. Musical performance is the most complex field of music. It comprises the study of a composition',s expression in terms of analysis, emotion, and gesture, and then its transformation into embodied reality, turning formulaic facts into dramatic movements of human cognition. Combining these components in a creative way is a sophisticated mix of knowledge and mastery, which more resembles the cooking of a delicate recipe than a rational procedure. This book is the first one aiming at such comprehensive coverage of the topic, and it does so also as a university text book. We include musicological and philosophical aspects as well as empirical performance research. Presenting analytical tools and case studies turns this project into a demanding enterprise in construction and experimental setups of performances, especially those generated by the music software Rubato. We are happy that this book was written following a course for performance students at the School of Music of the University of Minnesota.

This proposed text appears to be a good introduction to evolutionary computation for use in applied statistics research.

Modern statistical research is on the threshold of solving increasingly complex problems in high dimensions, and the generalization of its methodology to parameters whose estimators do not follow mathematically simple distributions is underway. Many of these challenges involve optimizing functions for which analytic solutions are infeasible. Evolutionary algorithms represent a powerful and easily understood means of approximating the optimum value in a variety of settings. The proposed text seeks to guide readers through the crucial issues of optimization problems in statistical settings and the implementation of tailored methods (including both stand-alone evolutionary algorithms and hybrid crosses of these procedures with standard statistical algorithms like Metropolis-Hastings) in a variety of applications.

It means that advice is seen as an artefact, as information communicated by an advisor to an advisee. Drawing on arguments in philosophy, recent empirical research in individual and group decision-making, and in information systems engineering, the book offers a rigorous approach to the analysis and design of advice in real-world decision situations, in which the advisor must manage with variously imprecise, unclear, incomplete or conflicting qualitative information. Advice involves recommendations on what to think; through thought, on what to choose; and via choices, on how to act. Advice is information that moves by communication, from advisors to the recipient of advice.Ivan Jureta offers a general way to analyze advice. The analysis applies regardless of what the advice is about and from whom it comes or to whom it needs to be given, and it concentrates on the production and consumption of advice independent of the field of application. It is made up of two intertwined parts, a conceptual analysis and an analysis of the rationale of advice. He premises that giving advice is a design problem and he treats advice as an artifact designed and used to influence decisions.What is unusual is the theoretical backdrop against which the author's discussions are set: ontology engineering, conceptual analysis, and artificial intelligence. While classical decision theory would be expected to play a key role, this is not the case here for one principal reason: the difficulty of having relevant numerical, quantitative estimates of probability and utility in most practical situations. Instead conceptual models and mathematical logic are the author's tools of choice.The book is primarily intended for graduate students and researchers of management science.

In modern society, prudence and probability calculation permeate our daily lives. Yet it is clear for all to see that neither cautious bank regulations nor mathematics have prevented economic crises from occurring time and again. Nicolas Bouleau argues that it is the meaning we assign to an event that determines the perceived risk, and that we generally turn a blind eye to this important fact, because the word \"meaning\" is itself awkward to explain. He tackles this fundamental question through examples taken from cultural fields ranging from painting, architecture, and music, to poetry, biology, and astronomy. This enables the reader to view overwhelming risks in a different light.

Due to the fast growth of the Web and the difficulties in finding desired information, efficient and effective information retrieval systems have become more important than ever, and the search engine has become an essential tool for many people. The ranker, a central component in every search engine, is responsible for the matching between processed queries and indexed documents. Because of its central role, great attention has been paid to the research and development of ranking technologies. In addition, ranking is also pivotal for many other information retrieval applications, such as collaborative filtering, definition ranking, question answering, multimedia retrieval, text summarization, and online advertisement. Leveraging machine learning technologies in the ranking process has led to innovative and more effective ranking models, and eventually to a completely new research area called learning to rank . Liu first gives a comprehensive review of the major approaches to learning to rank. For each approach he presents the basic framework, with example algorithms, and he discusses its advantages and disadvantages. He continues with some recent advances in learning to rank that cannot be simply categorized into the three major approaches these include relational ranking, query-dependent ranking, transfer ranking, and semisupervised ranking. His presentation is completed by several examples that apply these technologies to solve real information retrieval problems, and by theoretical discussions on guarantees for ranking performance.

Elliptic partial differential equations are important for approaching many problems in mathematical physics, and boundary integral methods play a significant role in their solution. This monograph investigates the latter as they arise in the theory characterizing stationary vibrations of thin elastic plates. The techniques used reduce the complexity of classical three-dimensional elasticity to a system of two independent variables, using eigenfrequencies to model problems with flexural-vibrational elastic body deformation and simplifying these problems to manageable, uniquely solvable integral equations. In under 250 pages, Stationary Oscillations of Elastic Plates develops an impressive amount of theoretical machinery. After introducing the equations describing the vibrations of elastic plates in the first chapter, the book proceeds to explore topics including the single-layer and double-layer plate potentials; the Newtonian potential; the exterior boundary value problems; the direct boundary integral equation method; the Robin boundary value problems; the boundary-contact problem; the null field equations. Throughout, ample time is allotted to laying the groundwork necessary for establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the problems discussed. The book is meant for readers with a knowledge of advanced calculus and some familiarity with functional analysis.

The aim of stochastic programming is to find optimal decisions in problems which involve uncertain data. This field is currently developing rapidly with contributions from many disciplines including operations research, mathematics, and probability. At the same time, it is now being applied in a wide variety of subjects ranging from agriculture to financial planning and from industrial engineering to computer networks. This textbook provides a first course in stochastic programming suitable for students with a basic knowledge of linear programming, elementary analysis, and probability. The authors aim to present a broad overview of the main themes and methods of the subject. Its prime goal is to help students develop an intuition on how to model uncertainty into mathematical problems, what uncertainty changes bring to the decision process, and what techniques help to manage uncertainty in solving the problems. In this extensively updated new edition there is more material on methods and examples including several new approaches for discrete variables, new results on risk measures in modeling and Monte Carlo sampling methods, a new chapter on relationships to other methods including approximate dynamic programming, robust optimization and online methods.

A paradigm shift is taking place in computer science: one generation ago, we learned to abstract from hardware to software, now we are abstracting from software to serviceware implemented through service-oriented computing. Yet ensuring interoperability in open, heterogeneous, and dynamically changing environments, such as the Internet, remains a major challenge for actual machine-to-machine integration. Usually significant problems in aligning data, processes, and protocols appear as soon as a specific piece of functionality is used within a different application context. The Semantic Web Services (SWS) approach is about describing services with metadata on the basis of domain ontologies as a means to enable their automatic location, execution, combination, and use. Fensel and his coauthors provide a comprehensive overview of SWS in line with actual industrial practice. They introduce the main sociotechnological components that ground the SWS vision (like Web Science, Service Science, and service-oriented architectures) and several approaches that realize it, e.g. the Web Service Modeling Framework, OWL-S, and RESTful services. The real-world relevance is emphasized through a series of case studies from large-scale RD projects and a business-oriented proposition from the SWS technology provider Seekda. Each chapter of the book is structured according to a predefined template, covering both theoretical and practical aspects, and including walk-through examples and hands-on exercises. Additional learning material is available on the book website www.swsbook.org. With its additional features, the book is ideally suited as the basis for courses or self-study in this field, and it may also serve as a reference for researchers looking for a state-of-the-art overview of formalisms, methods, tools, and applications related to SWS.

Annotation, Infrared spectroscopy is a new and innovative technology to study protein folding/misfolding events in the broad arsenal of techniques conventionally used in this field.

The most commonly used approaches rely on rapid mixing methods to initiate the folding event via a sudden change in solvent conditions. Traditionally, techniques such as fluorescence, circular dichroism or visible absorption are applied to probe the process. In contrast to these techniques, infrared spectroscopy came into play only very recently, and the progress made in this field up to date which now permits to probe folding events over the time scale from picoseconds to minutes has not yet been discussed in a book. The aim of this book is to provide an overview of the developments as seen by some of the main contributors to the field.

However, there are a number of arguments against this view. Environmental finance, particularly energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) finance, can and should serve as an interface to other sub-sectors of financial sector promotion such as microfinance, housing finance or agricultural finance. For example, existing clients of financial institutions include small and medium-sized enterprises and households, and these are often suffering from high energy prices or have no access to sustainable energy supply. At the same time, these clients are vulnerable to extreme weather events, and often hit hardest by the impact of climate change. There are many other examples which show that the financial sector has an enormous potential to support “green” investments. In order to tap this potential on a sustainable basis, it is important to have a sound understanding which role financial institutions can and should play. Likewise, financial institutions need to understand the demand side of environmental finance markets and the framework conditions in order to be able to design adequate financial products. This book provides a blend of well-founded professional and scientific perspectives on the potential of Environmental finance in developing and transition countries. All institutions and the clients they serve will be affected by the changing climate. In this new reality, green finance will not be a luxury, but a way of meeting clients' needs effectively and doing sound business. This book challenges, guides, inspires, and, at times, cautions us, in navigating this new normal.

At first sight, finitely generated abelian groups and canonical forms of matrices appear to have little in common. However, reduction to Smith normal form, named after its originator H.J.S.Smith in 1861, is a matrix version of the Euclidean algorithm and is exactly what the theory requires in both cases. Starting with matrices over the integers, Part 1 of this book provides a measured introduction to such groups: two finitely generated abelian groups are isomorphic if and only if their invariant factor sequences are identical. The analogous theory of matrix similarity over a field is then developed in Part 2 starting with matrices having polynomial entries: two matrices over a field are similar if and only if their rational canonical forms are equal. Under certain conditions each matrix is similar to a diagonal or nearly diagonal matrix, namely its Jordan form. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the elementary properties of rings and fields. Also a knowledge of abstract linear algebra including vector spaces, linear mappings, matrices, bases and dimension is essential, although much of the theory is covered in the text but from a more general standpoint: the role of vector spaces is widened to modules over commutative rings. Based on a lecture course taught by the author for nearly thirty years, the book emphasises algorithmic techniques and features numerous worked examples and exercises with solutions. The early chapters form an ideal second course in algebra for second and third year undergraduates. The later chapters, which cover closely related topics, e.g. field extensions, endomorphism rings, automorphism groups, and variants of the canonical forms, will appeal to more advanced students.

Many notions and results presented in the previous editions of this volume have since become quite popular in applications, and many of them have been “rediscovered” in applied papers. In the present 3rd edition small changes were made to the chapters in which long-time behavior of the perturbed system is determined by large deviations. Most of these changes concern terminology. In particular, it is explained that the notion of sub-limiting distribution for a given initial point and a time scale is identical to the idea of metastability, that the stochastic resonance is a manifestation of metastability, and that the theory of this effect is a part of the large deviation theory. The reader will also find new comments on the notion of quasi-potential that the authors introduced more than forty years ago, and new references to recent papers in which the proofs of some conjectures included in previous editions have been obtained. Apart from the above mentioned changes the main innovations in the 3rd edition concern the averaging principle. A new Section on deterministic perturbations of one-degree-of-freedom systems was added in Chapter 8. It is shown there that pure deterministic perturbations of an oscillator may lead to a stochastic, in a certain sense, long-time behavior of the system, if the corresponding Hamiltonian has saddle points. The usefulness of a joint consideration of classical theory of deterministic perturbations together with stochastic perturbations is illustrated in this section. Also a new Chapter 9 has been inserted in which deterministic and stochastic perturbations of systems with many degrees of freedom are considered. Because of the resonances, stochastic regularization in this case is even more important. 1.Random Perturbations -- 2.Small Random Perturbations on a Finite Time Interval -- 3.Action Functional -- 4.Gaussian Perturbations of Dynamical Systems.

This book gives a comprehensive treatment of the fundamental necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality for finite-dimensional, deterministic, optimal control problems. The emphasis is on the geometric aspects of the theory and on illustrating how these methods can be used to solve optimal control problems. It provides tools and techniques that go well beyond standard procedures and can be used to obtain a full understanding of the global structure of solutions for the underlying problem. The text includes a large number and variety of fully worked out examples that range from the classical problem of minimum surfaces of revolution to cancer treatment for novel therapy approaches. All these examples, in one way or the other, illustrate the power of geometric techniques and methods. The versatile text contains material on different levels ranging from the introductory and elementary to the advanced. Parts of the text can be viewed as a comprehensive textbook for both advanced undergraduate and all level graduate courses on optimal control in both mathematics and engineering departments. The text moves smoothly from the more introductory topics to those parts that are in a monograph style were advanced topics are presented. While the presentation is mathematically rigorous, it is carried out in a tutorial style that makes the text accessible to a wide audience of researchers and students from various fields, including the mathematical sciences and engineering.

Palik and a volume by Gorachand Ghosh, is a unique resource for any science and technology library. It provides materials researchers and optical device designers with reference facts in a context not available anywhere else. The singular functionality of the set derives from the unique format for the three core volumes that comprise the Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids. The Handbook satisfies several essential needs: first, it affords the most comprehensive database of the refractive index and extinction (or loss) coefficient of technically important and scientifically interesting dielectrics. This data has been critically selected and evaluated by authorities on each material. Second, the dielectric constant database is supplemented by tutorial chapters covering the basics of dielectric theory and reviews of experimental techniques for each wavelength region and material characteristic. As an additional resource, two of the tutorial chapters summarize the relevant characteristics of each of the materials in the database. The data in the core volumes have been collected and analyzed over a period of twelve years, with the most recent completed in 1997. The volumes systematically define the dielectric properties of 143 of the most engaging materials, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators. Together, the three Palik books contain nearly 3,000 pages, with about 2/3 devoted to the dielectric constant data. The tutorial chapters in the remaining 1/3 of the pages contain a wealth of information, including some dielectric data. Hence, the separate volume, Index to Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids, which is included as part of the set, substantially enhances the utility of the Handbook and in essence, joins all the Palik volumes into one unit. It isthen of great importance to users of the set. A final volume rounds out the set. The Handbook of Thermo-Optic Coefficients of Optical Materials with Applications collects refractive index measurements and their temperature dependence for a large number of crystals and glasses. Mathematical models represent these data, and in turn are used in the design of nonlinear optical devices. * Unique source of extremely useful optical data for a very broad community of scientists, researchers, and practitioners * Will be of great practical applicability to both industry and research * Presents optical constants for a broadest spectral range, for a very large number of materials: Paliks three volumes include 143 materials including 43 elements; Ghoshs volume includes some 70 technologically interesting crystals and many commercial glasses * Includes a special index volume that enables the user to search for the information in the three Palik volumes easily and quickly * Critique chapters in the Palik volumes discuss the data and give reference to most of the literature available for each material * Presents various techniques for measuring the optical constants and mathematical models for analytical calculations of some data Handbook of optical constants of solids I, II, & III / edited by Edward D.

Main concepts of quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) for killed processes are the focus of the present volume. For diffusions, the killing is at the boundary and for dynamical systems there is a trap. The authors present the QSDs as the ones that allow describing the long-term behavior conditioned to not being killed. Studies in this research area started with Kolmogorov and Yaglom and in the last few decades have received a great deal of attention. The authors provide the exponential distribution property of the killing time for QSDs, present the more general result on their existence and study the process of trajectories that survive forever. For birth-and-death chains and diffusions, the existence of a single or a continuum of QSDs is described. They study the convergence to the extremal QSD and give the classification of the survival process. In this monograph, the authors discuss Gibbs QSDs for symbolic systems and absolutely continuous QSDs for repellers. The findings described are relevant to researchers in the fields of Markov chains, diffusions, potential theory, dynamical systems, and in areas where extinction is a central concept. The theory is illustrated with numerous examples. The volume uniquely presents the distribution behavior of individuals who survive in a decaying population for a very long time.

This book presents recent advances (from 2008 to 2012) concerning use of the Naïve Bayes model in unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD). While WSD, in general, has a number of important applications in various fields of artificial intelligence (information retrieval, text processing, machine translation, message understanding, man-machine communication etc.), unsupervised WSD is considered important because it is language-independent and does not require previously annotated corpora. The Naïve Bayes model has been widely used in supervised WSD, but its use in unsupervised WSD has led to more modest disambiguation results and has been less frequent. It seems that the potential of this statistical model with respect to unsupervised WSD continues to remain insufficiently explored. The present book contends that the Naïve Bayes model needs to be fed knowledge in order to perform well as a clustering technique for unsupervised WSD and examines three entirely different sources of such knowledge for feature selection: WordNet, dependency relations and web N-grams. WSD with an underlying Naïve Bayes model is ultimately positioned on the border between unsupervised and knowledge-based techniques. The benefits of feeding knowledge (of various natures) to a knowledge-lean algorithm for unsupervised WSD that uses the Naïve Bayes model as clustering technique are clearly highlighted. The discussion shows that the Naïve Bayes model still holds promise for the open problem of unsupervised WSD. 1.Preliminaries -- 2.The Naïve Bayes Model in the Context of Word Sense Disambiguation -- 3.Semantic WordNet-based Feature Selection -- 4.Syntactic Dependency-based Feature Selection -- 5.N-Gram Features for Unsupervised WSD with an Underlying Naïve Bayes Model References -- Index. .", "title_en": "The Naïve Bayes Model for Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation : Aspects Concerning Feature Selection"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4204326-8", "gnd:4035843-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Hristea, Florentina T.", "year": "2013", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This book presents an integrated methodology for sequential experimentation in clinical trials. The methodology allows sequential learning during the course of a trial to improve the efficiency of the trial design, which often lacks adequate information at the planning stage. Adaptation via sequential learning of unknown parameters is a central idea not only in adaptive designs of confirmatory clinical trials but also in the theory of optimal nonlinear experimental design, which the book covers as introductory material. Other introductory topics for which the book provides preparatory background include sequential testing theory, dynamic programming and stochastic optimization, survival analysis and resampling methods. In this way, the book gives a self-contained and thorough treatment of group sequential and adaptive designs, time-sequential trials with failure-time endpoints, and statistical inference at the conclusion of these trials.

This book presents an introduction to viscoelasticity; in particular, to the theories of dilute polymer solutions and dilute suspensions of rigid particles in viscous and incompressible fluids. These theories are important, not just because they apply to practical problems of industrial interest, but because they form a solid theoretical base upon which mathematical techniques can be built, from which more complex theories can be constructed, to better mimic material behaviour. The emphasis is not on the voluminous current topical research, but on the necessary tools to understand viscoelasticity at a first year graduate level. The main aim is to provide a still compact book, sufficient at the level of first year graduate course for those who wish to understand viscoelasticity and to embark in modeling of viscoelastic multiphase fluids. To this end, a new chapter on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) was introduced which is relevant to model complex-structured fluids.

When the differential operator under discussion is of second order a variety of tools are available for dealing with such problems, including boundary integral methods, variational methods, harmonic measure techniques, and methods based on classical harmonic analysis. When the differential operator is of higher-order (as is the case, e.g., with anisotropic plate bending when one deals with a fourth order operator) only a few options could be successfully implemented. In the 1970s Alberto Calderón, one of the founders of the modern theory of Singular Integral Operators, advocated the use of layer potentials for the treatment of higher-order elliptic boundary value problems. The present monograph represents the first systematic treatment based on this approach. This research monograph lays, for the first time, the mathematical foundation aimed at solving boundary value problems for higher-order elliptic operators in non-smooth domains using the layer potential method and addresses a comprehensive range of topics, dealing with elliptic boundary value problems in non-smooth domains including layer potentials, jump relations, non-tangential maximal function estimates, multi-traces and extensions, boundary value problems with data in Whitney-Lebesque spaces, Whitney-Besov spaces, Whitney-Sobolev- based Lebesgue spaces, Whitney-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces,Whitney-Sobolev-based Hardy spaces, Whitney-BMO and Whitney-VMO spaces", "title_en": "Multi-Layer Potentials and Boundary Problems : for Higher-Order Elliptic Systems in Lipschitz Domains"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4322729-6", "gnd:4121184-4", "gnd:4048395-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Mitrea, Irina", "year": "2013", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This power extends to many kinds of searches, particularly to the problem of finding a specific location in a spatial layout, which can be modeled by a graph.

For over 50 years, scientists believed that life was the result of a chemical reaction involving simple molecules such as methane and ammonia cooking in a primordial soup.

At some point in their evolution, stars eject those organics and spread them all over the Milky Way galaxy. There is evidence that these organic dust particles actually reached the early Solar System. Through bombardments by comets and asteroids, the young Earth inherited significant amounts of stardust. Was the development of life assisted by the arrival of these extraterrestrial materials?

In recent years, the fabrication of nanomaterials and exploration of their properties have attracted the attention of various scientific disciplines such as biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering. Although nanoparticulate systems are of significant interest in various scientific and technological areas, there is little known about the safety of these nanoscale objects. It has now been established that the surfaces of nanoparticles are immediately covered by biomolecules (e.g. proteins, ions, and enzymes) upon their entrance into a biological medium. This interaction with the biological medium modulates the surface of the nanoparticles, conferring a “biological identity” to their surfaces (referred to as a “corona”), which determines the subsequent cellular/tissue responses. The new interface between the nanoparticles and the biological medium/proteins, called “bio-nano interface,” has been very rarely studied in detail to date, though the interest in this topic is rapidly growing. In this book, the importance of the physiochemical characteristics of nanoparticles for the properties of the protein corona is discussed in detail, followed by comprehensive descriptions of the methods for assessing the protein-nanoparticle interactions. The advantages and limitations of available corona evaluation methods (e.g. spectroscopy methods, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and differential centrifugal sedimentation) are examined in detail, followed by a discussion of the possibilities for enhancing the current methods and a call for new techniques.

The focus of this monograph is the study of rings and modules which have a rich supply of direct summands with respect to various extensions. The first four chapters of the book discuss rings and modules which generalize injectivity (e.g., extending modules), or for which certain annihilators become direct summands (e.g., Baer rings). Ring extensions such as matrix, polynomial, group ring, and essential extensions of rings from the aforementioned classes are considered in the next three chapters. A theory of ring and module hulls relative to a specific class of rings or modules is introduced and developed in the following two chapters. While applications of the results presented can be found throughout the book, the final chapter mainly consists of applications to algebra and functional analysis. These include obtaining characterizations of rings of quotients as direct products of prime rings and descriptions of certain C*-algebras via (quasi-)Baer rings. Extensions of Rings and Modules introduces for the first time in book form: * Baer, quasi-Baer, and Rickart modules * The theory of generalized triangular matrix rings via sets of triangulating idempotents * A discussion of essential overrings that are not rings of quotients of a base ring and Osofsky's study on the self-injectivity of the injective hull of a ring * Applications of the theory of quasi-Baer rings to C*-algebras Each section of the book is enriched with examples and exercises which make this monograph useful not only for experts but also as a text for advanced graduate courses.

Introduction -- Fundamental Concepts of Compositional Data Analysis -- Distributions for Random Compositions -- Descriptive Analysis of Compositional Data -- Linear Models for Compositions -- Multivariate Statistics -- Zeroes, Missings and Outliers -- References -- Index. . This book presents the statistical analysis of compositional data sets, i.e., data in percentages, proportions, concentrations, etc. The subject is covered from its grounding principles to the practical use in descriptive exploratory analysis, robust linear models and advanced multivariate statistical methods, including zeros and missing values, and paying special attention to data visualization and model display issues. Many illustrated examples and code chunks guide the reader into their modeling and interpretation. And, though the book primarily serves as a reference guide for the R package “compositions,” it is also a general introductory text on Compositional Data Analysis. Awareness of their special characteristics spread in the Geosciences in the early sixties, but a strategy for properly dealing with them was not available until the works of Aitchison in the eighties. Since then, research has expanded our understanding of their theoretical principles and the potentials and limitations of their interpretation. This is the first comprehensive textbook addressing these issues, as well as their practical implications with regard to software. The book is intended for scientists interested in statistically analyzing their compositional data.

This monograph provides an introduction to the concept of invariance entropy, the central motivation of which lies in the need to deal with communication constraints in networked control systems. For the simplest possible network topology, consisting of one controller and one dynamical system connected by a digital channel, invariance entropy provides a measure for the smallest data rate above which it is possible to render a given subset of the state space invariant by means of a symbolic coder-controller pair. This concept is essentially equivalent to the notion of topological feedback entropy introduced by Nair, Evans, Mareels and Moran (Topological feedback entropy and nonlinear stabilization.

The book presents the foundations of a theory which aims at finding expressions for invariance entropy in terms of dynamical quantities such as Lyapunov exponents.

This monograph covers some of the most important developments in Ramsey theory from its beginnings in the early 20th century via its many breakthroughs to recent important developments in the early 21st century. The book first presents a detailed discussion of the roots of Ramsey theory before offering a thorough discussion of the role of parameter sets. It presents several examples of structures that can be interpreted in terms of parameter sets and features the most fundamental Ramsey-type results for parameter sets: Hales-Jewett's theorem and Graham-Rothschild¹s Ramsey theorem as well as their canonical versions and several applications. Next, the book steps back to the most basic structure, to sets. It reviews classic results as well as recent progress on Ramsey numbers and the asymptotic behavior of classical Ramsey functions. In addition, the chapter presents product versions of Ramsey's theorem, a combinatorial proof of the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic, provides a digression to discrepancy theory, and examines extensions of Ramsey's theorem to larger cardinals. The next chapter features an in-depth treatment of the Ramsey problem for graphs and hypergraphs. It gives an account on the existence of sparse and restricted Ramsey theorem's using sophisticated constructions as well as probabilistic methods. Among others it contains a proof of the induced Graham-Rothschild theorem and the random Ramsey theorem.

Although there are many books on mathematical finance, few deal with the statistical aspects of modern data analysis as applied to financial problems. This book fills this gap by addressing some of the most challenging issues facing any financial engineer. It shows how sophisticated mathematics and modern statistical techniques can be used in concrete financial problems. Concerns of risk management are addressed by the control of extreme values, the fitting of distributions with heavy tails, the computation of values at risk (VaR), and other measures of risk. Data description techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), smoothing, and regression are applied to the construction of yield and forward curve. Nonparametric estimation and nonlinear filtering are used for option pricing and earnings prediction. The book is intended for undergraduate students majoring in financial engineering, or graduate students in a Master in finance or MBA program.

The early history of particle physics cannot be distinguished from the history of cosmic rays. With the advent of accelerators, however, the importance of cosmic rays in particle physics was lost. This situation persisted until the 1990s, when novel techniques allowed breakthrough discoveries, and exploration of new physics scales now requires returning to cosmic rays.

It also discusses the so-called mutually unbiased bases, which have applications in quantum information and quantum cryptography. Quantum logic and its applications to quantum gates is also studied. The second part studies finite quantum systems, where the position takes values in a Galois field. This combines quantum mechanics with Galois theory. The third part extends the discussion to quantum systems with variables in profinite groups, considering the limit where the dimension of the system becomes very large. It uses the concepts of inverse and direct limit and studies quantum mechanics on p-adic numbers.

Crystals are everywhere, from natural crystals (minerals) through the semiconductors and magnetic materials in electronic devices and computers or piezoelectric resonators at the heart of our quartz watches to electro-optical devices. Understanding them in depth is essential both for pure research and for their applications. This book provides a clear, thorough presentation of their symmetry, both at the microscopic space-group level and the macroscopic point-group level. The implications of the symmetry of crystals for their physical properties are then presented, together with their mathematical description in terms of tensors. The conditions on the symmetry of a crystal for a given property to exist then become clear, as does the symmetry of the property. The geometrical representation of tensor quantities or properties is presented, and its use in determining important relationships emphasized. An original feature of this book is that most chapters include exercises with complete solutions. This allows readers to test and improve their understanding of the material. The intended readership includes undergraduate and graduate students in materials science and materials-related aspects of electrical and optical engineering; researchers involved in the investigation of the physical properties of crystals and the design of applications based on crystal properties such as piezoelectricity, electro-optics, optical activity and all those involved in the characterization of the structural properties of materials", "title_en": "Symmetry and Physical Properties of Crystals"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4033209-3", "gnd:4134738-9", "gnd:4165768-8", "gnd:4033217-2", "gnd:4072157-7", "gnd:4136175-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Malgrange, Cécile", "year": "2014", "type": "Book", "language_original": "fr"}}

This book offers a general introduction to the geometrical studies of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) and his mathematical epistemology. In particular, it focuses on his theory of parallel lines and his attempts to prove the famous Parallel Postulate. Furthermore it explains the role that Leibniz’s work played in the development of non-Euclidean geometry. The first part is an overview of his epistemology of geometry and a few of his geometrical findings, which puts them in the context of the seventeenth-century studies on the foundations of geometry. It also provides a detailed mathematical and philosophical commentary on his writings on the theory of parallels, and discusses how they were received in the eighteenth century as well as their relevance for the non-Euclidean revolution in mathematics. The second part offers a collection of Leibniz’s essays on the theory of parallels and an English translation of them. While a few of these papers have already been published (in Latin) in the standard Leibniz editions, most of them are transcribed from Leibniz’s manuscripts written in Hannover, and published here for the first time.

The chapters give emphasis to approaches from environmental geography, functional ecology, biogeography, and paleoenvironmental reconstructions. The introductory and closing chapters summarize the main challenges that nature conservation may face in mountain areas under the environmental shifting conditions. This interdisciplinary book will appeal to researchers in mountain ecosystems, students and nature professionals.

In the past decade, many countries have designed explicit internationalisation policies for their higher education systems, acknowledging the benefits of international exposure to prepare students for a globalising economy as well as the many opportunities of cross-border mobility for innovation, improvement and capacity development in higher education and in the economy. Cases of fraud and opportunistic behaviour have shown that these promises come with risks for students and other tertiary education stakeholders though. It is precisely to help all stakeholders to minimise these risks and strengthen the dynamics of openness, collaboration and transparency across countries that UNESCO and OECD jointly developed the Guidelines for Quality Provision in Cross-Border Higher Education. This book monitors the extent to which tertiary education stakeholders complied with the Guidelines in 2014. It will be of interest to policy makers, leaders of tertiary education institutions and quality assurance agencies, as well as to academics and other parties interested in higher education and its internationalisation.", "title_en": "Ensuring quality in cross-border higher education : implementing the UNESCO/OECD guidelines"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4047966-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5157-3", "year": "2015", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Porous materials with ultrahigh surface area are of great interest for potential applications in energy storage and environmental remediation. Porous Polymers describes the significant recent progress in the development of different porous frameworks, with a particular focus on the relationship between structure design, synthesis method and properties. The book starts with an introduction to porous materials and their functions followed by chapters looking at the design of porous polymers, synthesis methods of porous polymers (reversible methods, irreversible methods, copolymerization methods and self-polymerization methods); characterisation of porous polymer structures and post-synthesis techniques of porous polymers (lithiation, sulphonation, carbonization, grafting). Specific chapters then detail different porous materials systems such as conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs); covalent organic frameworks (COFs); hyper-crosslinked polymers (HCPs); polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs); and porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs).Written by active researchers in the field, the book provides a comprehensive overview of different porous polymer systems for researchers and graduate students in chemistry and materials science working on novel materials and those interested in the energy and environmental applications", "title_en": "Porous polymers : design, synthesis and applications"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4046811-2", "gnd:4046699-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Qiu, Shilun; Ben, Teng", "year": "2015", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The transformation of West German society in the \"long\" 1950s led to changes in society's understanding of masculinity. Men who were \"different\" - disabled war veterans, the homeless, homosexuals - were under pressure to conform. This book tells the stories of men who were \"flawed,\" expounds on the \"crisis of masculinity,\" and illuminates the forces that promoted and inhibited greater life-style diversity. Die Nachkriegszeit gilt als Phase der \"Remaskulinisierung\". Gesellschaftlich akzeptierte Vorstellungen von Männlichkeit, die auf Leistungskraft, Gemeinschaftsorientierung und Heterosexualität fußten, setzten Männer, die \"anders\" waren, unter Konformitätsdruck. Aber wie wirkten sich die Selbstbehauptungsversuche von Kriegsversehrten, Obdachlosen oder Homosexuellen auf das vorherrschende Männlichkeitsideal aus?

The implementation of advanced computer arithmetic by fast hardware is examined in the book. The new expanded computational capability is gained at modest cost. It increases both the speed of a computation and the accuracy of the computed result. With it fast multiple precision arithmetic can be easily provided.

The purpose of presenting this book to the scholarly world is twofold. In the first place, I wish to provide for the English reader a translation of the earliest extant Arabic work of Hindi arithmetic. It shows this system at its earliest stages and the first steps in its development, a subject not yet well known except for readers of some Arabic publications by the present writer. This book is therefore of particular importance for students of the history of mathematical techniques. The medieval author, AI-UqHdisI, was, it seems, not noticed by bibliographers; neither was his work, which lay hardly noticed by modern scholars until 1960 when I happened to see a microfilm copy of it in the Institute of Arabic Manu­ scripts in Cairo. A steady labour immediately followed to make a comparative study of the text together with over twenty other texts, some of them not yet known to scholars. This pursuit resulted in (i) a doctoral degree awarded to me in 1966 by the University of Khartoum, (ii) the publication of several texts in Arabic including the text here translated, and (iii) the publication of several articles in Arabic and English on the history of arithmetic in the Middle Ages. The second purpose of this book is to make the main results of my study available to the English reader.", "title_en": "The Arithmetic of Al-Uqlīdisī : The Story of Hindu-Arabic Arithmetic as told in Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al-Hindī"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4037944-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "al-Ḥasan Ahmad, Abū", "year": "1978", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This book is designed to be a practical progression of experimental techniques an investigator may follow when embarking on a biochemical project. The protocols may be performed in the order laid out or may be used inde­ pendently. The aim of the book is to assist a wide range of researchers. from the novice to the frustrated veteran, in the choice and design of experiments that are to be performed to provide answers to specific questions. The manual describes standard techniques that have been shown to work, as well as some newer ones that are beginning to prove important. By following the promi­ nently numbered steps. you can work your way through any protocol. whether it's a new technique or a task you've done before for which you need a quick review or updated methodology. This manual will assist the experimentalist in designing properly controlled experiments. There will be no advice for dealing with specific pieces of equip­ ment other than encouragement to read the manual, if you can find it. Through­ out all manipulations try to be objective. Be on the lookout for unexpected findings. You will learn the most from unexpected results. and they are often the beginning of the next project.

Item response theory has become an essential component in the toolkit of every researcher in the behavioral sciences. It provides a powerful means to study individual responses to a variety of stimuli, and the methodology has been extended and developed to cover many different models of interaction. This volume presents a wide-ranging handbook to item response theory - and its applications to educational and psychological testing. It will serve as both an introduction to the subject and also as a comprehensive reference volume for practitioners and researchers. It is organized into six major sections: the nominal categories model, models for response time or multiple attempts on items, models for multiple abilities or cognitive components, nonparametric models, models for nonmonotone items, and models with special assumptions. Each chapter in the book has been written by an expert of that particular topic, and the chapters have been carefully edited to ensure that a uniform style of notation and presentation is used throughout. As a result, all researchers whose work uses item response theory will find this an indispensable companion to their work and it will be the subject's reference volume for many years to come.", "title_en": "Handbook of Modern Item Response Theory"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4038971-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Linden, Wim J.", "year": "1997", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

For a vector field #3, where Ai are series in X, the algebraic multiplicity measures the singularity at the origin.

A logarithmic point of view is taken, marking the exceptional divisor of each blowing-up and by considering only the vector fields which are tangent to this divisor, instead of the whole tangent sheaf. The first part of the book is devoted to the logarithmic background and to the permissible blowing-ups. The main part corresponds to the control of the algorithms for the desingularization strategies by means of numerical invariants inspired by Hironaka's characteristic polygon.

Over the last two decades the development, evaluation and use of MFM systems has been a major focus for the Oil & Gas industry worldwide. Since the early 1990's, when the first commercial meters started to appear, there have been around 2,000 field applications of MFM for field allocation, production optimisation and well testing. So far, many alternative metering systems have been developed, but none of them can be referred to as generally applicable or universally accurate. Both established and novel technologies suitable to measure the flow rates of gas, oil and water in a three-phase flow are reviewed and assessed within this book. Those technologies already implemented in the various commercial meters are evaluated in terms of operational and economical advantages or shortcomings from an operator point of view. The lessons learned about the practical reliability, accuracy and use of the available technology is discussed.

The sweeping process by a moving convex set in a Hilbert space plays a central role. The latest existence results concerning this process are presented in chapter 2. In chapters 3 and 4, the study of the mechanical problems is undertaken. Connected areas of research are briefly reviewed in chapter 5. Proofs are constructive whenever possible and convergence of algorithms is often considered.

In recent years, new algorithms for dealing with rings of differential operators have been discovered and implemented. A main tool is the theory of Gröbner bases, which is reexamined here from the point of view of geometric deformations. Perturbation techniques have a long tradition in analysis; Gröbner deformations of left ideals in the Weyl algebra are the algebraic analogue to classical perturbation techniques. The algorithmic methods introduced in this book are particularly useful for studying the systems of multidimensional hypergeometric partial differentiel equations introduced by Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky. The Gröbner deformation of these GKZ hypergeometric systems reduces problems concerning hypergeometric functions to questions about commutative monomial ideals, and thus leads to an unexpected interplay between analysis and combinatorics. This book contains a number of original research results on holonomic systems and hypergeometric functions, and it raises many open problems for future research in this rapidly growing area of computational mathematics '", "title_en": "Gröbner Deformations of Hypergeometric Differential Equations"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4276378-2", "gnd:4261657-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:121330451", "year": "2000", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Bayesian nonparametrics has grown tremendously in the last three decades, especially in the last few years. This book is the first systematic treatment of Bayesian nonparametric methods and the theory behind them. While the book is of special interest to Bayesians, it will also appeal to statisticians in general because Bayesian nonparametrics offers a whole continuous spectrum of robust alternatives to purely parametric and purely nonparametric methods of classical statistics. The book is primarily aimed at graduate students and can be used as the text for a graduate course in Bayesian nonparametrics. Though the emphasis of the book is on nonparametrics, there is a substantial chapter on asymptotics of classical Bayesian parametric models.

A collection of matrices is said to be triangularizable if there is an invertible matrix S such that S1 AS is upper triangular for every A in the collection. This generalization of commutativity is the subject of many classical theorems due to Engel, Kolchin, Kaplansky, McCoy and others. The concept has been extended to collections of bounded linear operators on Banach spaces: such a collection is defined to be triangularizable if there is a maximal chain of subspaces of the Banach space, each of which is invariant under every member of the collection. Most of the classical results have been generalized to compact operators, and there are also recent theorems in the finite-dimensional case. This book is the first comprehensive treatment of triangularizability in both the finite and infinite-dimensional cases. It contains numerous very recent results and new proofs of many of the classical theorems. It provides a thorough background for research in both the linear-algebraic and operator-theoretic aspects of triangularizability and related areas. More generally, the book will be useful to anyone interested in matrices or operators, as many of the results are linked to other topics such as spectral mapping theorems, properties of spectral radii and traces, and the structure of semigroups and algebras of operators.

The text of this book is derived from courses taught by the author in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The audience for these courses was composed almost entirely of fourth year undergraduate students majoring in the mathematical sciences. The students had ordinarily completed four semesters of calculus and one of probability. Few had any prior experience with differential equations, stochastic processes, or epidemiology. It also seems prudent to mention that the author's background is in engineering and applied mathematics and not in epidemiology; it is hoped that this is not painfully obvious. The topics covered in this book have in some cases been modified from the way they were originally presented. However, care has been taken to include a suitable amount of material for a one semester course; the temptation to add gratuitous subject matter has been resisted. Similarly, when a choice between clarity and rigor was available, the more easily understood exposition was selected. By looking only at the table of contents, the casual reader could be easily misled into thinking that the main concern of this book is with epidemiology. This is not the case.

Abelian varieties are a natural generalization of elliptic curves to higher dimensions, whose geometry and classification are as rich in elegant results as in the one-dimensional ease. The use of theta functions, particularly since Mumford's work, has been an important tool in the study of abelian varieties and invertible sheaves on them. Also, abelian varieties play a significant role in the geometric approach to modern algebraic number theory. In this book, Kempf has focused on the analytic aspects of the geometry of abelian varieties, rather than taking the alternative algebraic or arithmetic points of view. His purpose is to provide an introduction to complex analytic geometry. Thus, he uses Hermitian geometry as much as possible. One distinguishing feature of Kempf's presentation is the systematic use of Mumford's theta group. This allows him to give precise results about the projective ideal of an abelian variety. In its detailed discussion of the cohomology of invertible sheaves, the book incorporates material previously found only in research articles.

These notes were developed from a course taught at Rice Univ- sity in the spring of 1976 and again at the University of Hawaii in the spring of 1977. It is assumed that the students know some linear algebra and a little about differentiation of vector-valued functions. The idea is to introduce students to some of the concepts of Lie group theory--all done at the concrete level of matrix groups. As much as we could, we motivated developments as a means of deciding when two matrix groups (with different definitions) are isomorphie. In Chapter I \"group\" is defined and examples are given; ho- morphism and isomorphism are defined. For a field k denotes the algebra of n x n matrices over k We recall that A E Mn(k) has an inverse if and only if det A # 0 , and define the general linear group GL(n,k) We construct the skew-field E of quaternions and note that for A E Mn(E) to operate linearlyon Rn we must operate on the right (since we multiply a vector by a scalar n n on the left). So we use row vectors for Rn, c E and write xA , for the row vector obtained by matrix multiplication. We get a complex-valued determinant function on Mn (E) such that det A # 0 guarantees that A has an inverse.", "title_en": "Matrix Groups"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4169127-1", "gnd:4072157-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1145364071", "year": "1979", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

By including classical results as well as recent developments in the field of hydrodynamic stability and transition, the book can be used as a textbook for an introductory, graduate-level course in stability theory or for a special-topics fluids course. It will also be of value as a reference for researchers in the field of hydrodynamic stability theory or with an interest in recent developments in fluid dynamics. Since the appearance of \"Drazin & Reid\", no book on hydrodynamic stability theory has been published. However, stability theory has seen a rapid development over the past decade. Direct numerical simulations of transition to turbulence and linear analysis based on the initial-value problem are two of many such developments that will be included in the book", "title_en": "Stability and Transition in Shear Flows"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4128478-1", "gnd:4249988-4", "gnd:4056693-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Schmid, Peter J.", "year": "2001", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Stratified fluids whose densities, sound speeds and other parameters are functions of a single depth coordinate occur widely in nature. Indeed, the earth's gravitational field imposes a stratification on its atmosphere, oceans and lakes. It is well known that their stratification has a profound effect on the propagation of sound in these fluids. The most striking effect is probably the occurrence of acoustic ducts, due to minima of the sound speed, that can trap sound waves and cause them to propagate hori­ zontally. The reflection, transmission and distortion of sonar signals by acoustic ducts is important in interpreting sonar echoes. Signal scattering by layers of microscopic marine organisms is important to both sonar engi­ neers and marine biologists. Again, reflection of signals from bottom sediment layers overlying a penetrable bottom are of interest both as sources of unwanted echoes and in the acoustic probing of such layers. Many other examples could be given. The purpose of this monograph is to develop from first principles a theory of sound propagation in stratified fluids whose densities and sound speeds are essentially arbitrary functions of the depth. In physical terms, the propagation of both time-harmonic and transient fields is analyzed. The corresponding mathematical model leads to the study of boundary value problems for a scalar wave equation whose coefficients contain the pre­ scribed density and sound speed functions. 1.

In the end of the last century, Oliver Heaviside inaugurated an operational calculus in connection with his researches in electromagnetic theory. In his operational calculus, the operator of differentiation was denoted by the symbol \"p\". The explanation of this operator p as given by him was difficult to understand and to use, and the range of the valid­ ity of his calculus remains unclear still now, although it was widely noticed that his calculus gives correct results in general. In the 1930s, Gustav Doetsch and many other mathematicians began to strive for the mathematical foundation of Heaviside's operational calculus by virtue of the Laplace transform -pt e f(t)dt. ( However, the use of such integrals naturally confronts restrictions con­ cerning the growth behavior of the numerical function f(t) as t ~ ~. At about the midcentury, Jan Mikusinski invented the theory of con­ volution quotients, based upon the Titchmarsh convolution theorem: If f(t) and get) are continuous functions defined on [O,~) such that the convolution f~ f(t-u)g(u)du =0, then either f(t) =0 or get) =0 must hold. The convolution quotients include the operator of differentiation \"s\" and related operators. Mikusinski's operational calculus gives a satisfactory basis of Heaviside's operational calculus; it can be applied successfully to linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients as well as to the telegraph equation which includes both the wave and heat equa­ tions with constant coefficients.

The canonical way to establish the central limit theorem for i.i.d. random variables is to use characteristic functions and Lévy’s continuity theorem.

This type of convergence is a relatively new concept with many deep ramifications, and has not previously been published in a single accessible volume. The authors construct an extremely flexible framework using this concept in order to study limit theorems and large deviations for a number of probabilistic models related to classical probability, combinatorics, non-commutative random variables, as well as geometric and number-theoretical objects.

The first is the mathematical community, to show the contribution of mathematics to this domain and to highlight some unresolved theoretical questions. The second is the computer vision community, to present a clear, self-contained, and global overview of the mathematics involved in image processing problems. The book is divided into five main parts. Chapter 1 is a detailed overview. Chapter 2 describes and illustrates most of the mathematical notions found throughout the work. Chapters 3 and 4 examine how PDEs and variational methods can be successfully applied in image restoration and segmentation processes.

This monograph discusses Lundberg approximations for compound distributions with special emphasis on applications in insurance risk modeling. These distributions are somewhat awkward from an analytic standpoint, but play a central role in insurance and other areas of applied probability modeling such as queueing theory. Consequently, the material is of interest to researchers and graduate students interested in these areas. The material is self-contained, but an introductory course in insurance risk theory is beneficial to prospective readers. Lundberg asymptotics and bounds have a long history in connection with ruin probabilities and waiting time distributions in queueing theory, and have more recently been extended to compound distributions. This connection has its roots in the compound geometric representation of the ruin probabilities and waiting time distributions. A systematic treatment of these approximations is provided, drawing heavily on monotonicity ideas from reliability theory. The results are then applied to the solution of defective renewal equations, analysis of the time and severity of insurance ruin, and renewal risk models, which may also be viewed in terms of the equilibrium waiting time distribution in the G/G/1 queue. Many known results are derived and extended so that much of the material has not appeared elsewhere in the literature. A unique feature involves the use of elementary analytic techniques which require only undergraduate mathematics as a prerequisite. New proofs of many results are given, and an extensive bibliography is provided. Gordon Willmot is Professor of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo.

HEARN THE RAND CORPORATION, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA REDUCE is a computer program for algebraic computation that IS III world-wide use by thousands of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. Although it traces its beginnings to 1963, until recently it has only been available on main-frame computers because of its relatively large resource requirements. In 1980 I predicted (1) that by the mid-1980's it would be possible to obtain personal computers in the $10,000 $20,000 range capable of running REDUCE. I am therefore delighted to see that machines of the power of the IBM PC can now run this system, even though these computers are more modestly priced than my 1980 vision of the personal algebra machine. In addition to the need for the more widespread access that personal computers can now provide, there has been a longstanding need for a textbook to help the beginning user become better acquainted with the system. I am therefore very glad that Dr. Rayna has undertaken to write such a book, just as the era of the REDUCE personal algebra machine is beginning. In order to understand the nature of REDUCE, a little history is in order.

The purpose of this book is to introduce two recent topics in mathematical physics and probability theory: the Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLE) and interacting particle systems related to random matrix theory. A typical example of the latter systems is Dyson's Brownian motion (BM) model. The SLE and Dyson's BM model may be considered as \"children\" of the Bessel process with parameter D, BES(D), and the SLE and Dyson's BM model as \"grandchildren\" of BM. In Chap. 1 the parenthood of BM in diffusion processes is clarified and BES(D) is defined for any D ≥ 1. Dependence of the BES(D) path on its initial value is represented by the Bessel flow. In Chap. 2 SLE is introduced as a complexification of BES(D). Rich mathematics and physics involved in SLE are due to the nontrivial dependence of the Bessel flow on D. From a result for the Bessel flow, Cardy's formula in Carleson's form is derived for SLE. In Chap. 3 Dyson's BM model with parameter β is introduced as a multivariate extension of BES(D) with the relation D = β + 1. The book concentrates on the case where β = 2 and calls this case simply the Dyson model. The Dyson model inherits the two aspects of BES(3); hence it has very strong solvability. That is, the process is proved to be determinantal in the sense that all spatio-temporal correlation functions are given by determinants, and all of them are controlled by a single function called the correlation kernel. From the determinantal structure of the Dyson model, the Tracy–Widom distribution is derived. .", "title_en": "Bessel Processes, Schramm–Loewner Evolution, and the Dyson Model"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:1122311605", "gnd:1122311176"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Katori, Makoto", "year": "2016", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Metastability is a wide-spread phenomenon in the dynamics of non-linear systems - physical, chemical, biological or economic - subject to the action of temporal random forces typically referred to as noise. This monograph provides a concise presentation of mathematical approach to metastability based on potential theory of reversible Markov processes. The authors shed new light on the metastability phenomenon as a sequence of visits of the path of the process to different metastable sets, and focus on the precise analysis of the respective hitting probabilities and hitting times of these sets. The theory is illustrated with many examples, ranging from finite-state Markov chains, finite-dimensional diffusions and stochastic partial differential equations, via mean-field dynamics with and without disorder, to stochastic spin-flip and particle-hopping dynamics and probabilistic cellular automata, unveiling the common universal features of these systems with respect to their metastable behaviour.

It is a gateway to prosperity of individuals and economies alike. Integrity in education matters too. Corruption hinders prosperity, causes long-term damage to societies, and diminishes the efficiency of investment in their human potential. Driven by the insight that corruption in education can undermine even the best of intentions, the Republic of Serbia requested the OECD to assess the integrity of its education system – to collect evidence on shortcomings and strengths, to provide a forecast of corruption incidence, and to identify solutions for closing the gaps. This first of its kind integrity report seeks to give pragmatic answers to these queries and support authorities and stakeholders in taking informed decisions on how to strengthen integrity and prevent corruption in the sector. It uses a novel methodology for assessing the integrity of education systems (INTES) to identify the underlying causes of malpractice, and point out areas in need of attention.

Conclusion Troubleshoot the most widespread and pernicious Java performance problems using a set of open-source and freely-available tools that will make you dramatically more productive in finding the root causes of slow performance. This is a brief book that focuses on a small number of performance anti-patterns, and you’ll find that most problems you encounter fit into one of these anti-patterns. The book provides a specific method in a series of steps referred to as the “P.A.t.h. Checklist” that encompasses persistence, alien systems, threads, and heap management. These steps guide you through a troubleshooting process that is repeatable, that you can apply to any performance problem in a Java application. This technique is especially helpful in 'dark' environments with little monitoring. Performance problems are not always localized to Java, but often fall into the realms of database access and server load. This book gives attention to both of these issues through exa mples showing how to identify repetitive SQL, and identify architecture-wide performance problems ahead of production rollout. Learn how to apply load like an expert, and determine how much load to apply to determine whether your system scales. Included are walk-throughs of a dozen server-side performance puzzles that are ready to run on your own machine. Following these examples helps you learn to: Assess the performance health of four main problems areas in a Java system: The P.A.t.h. Checklist presents each area with its own set of plug-it-in-now tools Pinpoint the code at fault for CPU and other bottlenecks without a Java profiler Find memory leaks in just minutes using heapSpank, the author's open-source leak detector utility that is freely available from heapSpank.org The repeatable method provided in this book is an antidote to lackluster average response times that are multi-second throughout the industry. This book prov ides a long absent, easy-to-follow, performance training regimen that will benefit anyone programming in Java. What You Will Learn: Avoid the 6 most common ways to mess up a load test Determine the exact number of threads to dial into the load generator to test your system's scalability Detect the three most common SQL performance anti-patterns Measure network response times of calls to back-end systems ('alien systems') Identify whether garbage collection performance is healthy or unhealthy and whether delays are caused by problems in the old or new generation, so ...", "title_en": "Troubleshooting Java Performance : Detecting Anti-Patterns with Open Source Tools"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4153834-1", "gnd:4401313-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Ostermueller, Erik", "year": "2017", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This monograph aims to provide a unified, geometrical foundation of gauge theories of elementary particle physics. The underlying geometrical structure is unfolded in a coordinate-free manner via the modern mathematical notions of fibre bundles and exterior forms. Topics such as the dynamics of Yang-Mills theories, instanton solutions and topological invariants are included. By transferring these concepts to local space-time symmetries, generalizations of Einstein's theory of gravity arise in a Riemann-Cartan space with curvature and torsion. It provides the framework in which the (broken) Poincaré gauge theory, the Rainich geometrization of the Einstein-Maxwell system, and higher-dimensional, non-abelian Kaluza-Klein theories are developed. Since the discovery of the Higgs boson, concepts of spontaneous symmetry breaking in gravity have come again into focus, and, in this revised edition, these will be exposed in geometric terms. Quantizing gravity remains an open issue: formulating it as a de Sitter type gauge theory in the spirit of Yang-Mills, some new progress in its topological form is presented. After symmetry breaking, Einstein’s standard general relativity with cosmological constant emerges as a classical background. The geometrical structure of BRST quantization with non-propagating topological ghosts is developed in some detail.

Through this book, researchers and students will learn to use R for analysis of large-scale genomic data and how to create routines to automate analytical steps. The philosophy behind the book is to start with real world raw datasets and perform all the analytical steps needed to reach final results. Though theory plays an important role, this is a practical book for advanced undergraduate and graduate classes in bioinformatics, genomics and statistical genetics or for use in lab sessions. This book is also designed to be used by students in computer science and statistics who want to learn the practical aspects of genomic analysis without delving into algorithmic details. The datasets used throughout the book may be downloaded from the publisher’s website. Chapters show how to handle and manage high-throughput genomic data, create automated workflows and speed up analyses in R. A wide range of R packages useful for working with genomic data are illustrated with practical examples. In recent years R has become the de facto tool for analysis of gene expression data, in addition to its prominent role in the analysis of genomic data. Benefits to using R include the integrated development environment for analysis, flexibility and control of the analytic workflow. At a time when genomic data is decidedly big, the skills from this book are critical. The key topics covered are association studies, genomic prediction, estimation of population genetic parameters and diversity, gene expression analysis, functional annotation of results using publically available databases and how to work efficiently in R with large genomic datasets. Important principles are demonstrated and illustrated through engaging examples which invite the reader to work with the provided datasets. Some methods that are discussed in this volume include: signatures of selection; population parameters (LD, FST, FIS, etc); use of a genomic relationship matrix for population diversity studies; use of SNP data for parentage testing; snpBLUP and gBLUP for genomic prediction. Step-by-step, all the R code required for a genome-wide association study is shown: starting from raw SNP data, how to build databases to handle and manage the data, quality control and filtering measures, association testing and evaluation of results, through to identification and functional annotation of candidate genes.

Yet their economic growth has not kept pace. Why? One factor might be low capital investment, due in part to Africa's relative poverty: Other regions have reached similar stages of urbanization at higher per capita GDP. This study, however, identifies a deeper reason: African cities are closed to the world. Compared with other developing cities, cities in Africa produce few goods and services for trade on regional and international markets. To grow economically as they are growing in size, Africa's cities must open their doors to the world. They need to specialize in manufacturing, along with other regionally and globally tradable goods and services. And to attract global investment in tradables production, cities must develop scale economies, which are associated with successful urban economic development in other regions. Such scale economies can arise in Africa, and they will-if city and country leaders make concerted efforts to bring agglomeration effects to urban areas. Today, potential urban investors and entrepreneurs look at Africa and see crowded, disconnected, and costly cities. Such cities inspire low expectations for the scale of urban production and for returns on invested capital. How can these cities become economically dense-not merely crowded? How can they acquire efficient connections? And how can they draw firms and skilled workers with a more affordable, livable urban environment? From a policy standpoint, the answer must be to address the structural problems affecting African cities. Foremost among these problems are institutional and regulatory constraints that misallocate land and labor, fragment physical development, and limit productivity. As long as African cities lack functioning land markets and regulations and early, coordinated infrastructure investments, they will remain local cities: closed to regional and global markets, trapped into producing only locally traded goods and services, and limited in their economic growth", "title_en": "Africa's cities : opening doors to the world"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4056730-8", "gnd:4056733-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Antos, Sarah; Aguilera, Ana; Avner, Paolo; Nakamura, Shohei; Huang, Chyi-Yun; Aguilar, Juliana", "year": "2017", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The second edition of this highly praised textbook provides an expanded introduction to the theory of ordered sets and its connections to various subjects. Utilizing a modular presentation, the core material is purposely kept brief, allowing for the benefits of a broad exposure to the subject without the risk of overloading the reader with too much information all at once. The remaining chapters can then be read in almost any order, giving the text a greater depth and flexibility of use. Most topics are introduced by examining how they relate to research problems, some of them still open, allowing for continuity among diverse topics and encouraging readers to explore these problems further with research of their own. A wide range of material is presented, from classical results such as Dilworth's, Szpilrajn's, and Hashimoto's Theorems to more recent results such as the Li-Milner Structure Theorem. Major topics covered include chains and antichains, lowest upper and greatest lower bounds, retractions, algorithmic approaches, lattices, the dimension of ordered sets, interval orders, lexicographic sums, products, enumeration, and the role of algebraic topology. This new edition shifts the primary focus to finite ordered sets, with results on infinite ordered sets presented toward the end of each chapter whenever possible. Also new are Chapter 6 on graphs and homomorphisms, which serves to separate the fixed clique property from the more fundamental fixed simplex property as well as to discuss the connections and differences between graph homomorphisms and order-preserving maps, and an appendix on discrete Morse functions and their use for the fixed point property for ordered sets. Rich in examples, diagrams, and exercises, the second edition of Ordered Sets will be an excellent text for undergraduate and graduate students and a valuable resource for interested researchers. It will be especially useful to those looking for an introduction to the theory of ordered sets and its connections to such areas as algebraic topology, analysis, and computer science. PRAISE FOR THE FIRST EDITION \"The author has done the field a service by producing an excellent text strong in the presentation of certain topological aspects of the underlying diagrams, e.g., which should serve the developing community and field well and which can be recommended without reservations as one of the volumes which should grace a poseteer's library whether she is interested only or mainly in the theory of these objects or has directed her gaze towards applications.

This is a textbook on proof writing in the area of analysis, balancing a survey of the core concepts of mathematical proof with a tight, rigorous examination of the specific tools needed for an understanding of analysis. Instead of the standard \"transition\" approach to teaching proofs, wherein students are taught fundamentals of logic, given some common proof strategies such as mathematical induction, and presented with a series of well-written proofs to mimic, this textbook teaches what a student needs to be thinking about when trying to construct a proof. Covering the fundamentals of analysis sufficient for a typical beginning Real Analysis course, it never loses sight of the fact that its primary focus is about proof writing skills. This book aims to give the student precise training in the writing of proofs by explaining exactly what elements make up a correct proof, how one goes about constructing an acceptable proof, and, by learning to recognize a correct proof, how to avoid writing incorrect proofs. To this end, all proofs presented in this text are preceded by detailed explanations describing the thought process one goes through when constructing the proof. Over 150 example proofs, templates, and axioms are presented alongside full-color diagrams to elucidate the topics at hand.

However, due to high raw material and processing costs, biofuels produced from lignocelluloses have been found to be more expensive than conventional fuels.

The text is broadly divided into two main parts. The first part gives atomic, molecular, and grand maximal function characterizations of Hardy spaces and formulates sharp versions of basic analytical tools for quasi-metric spaces, such as a Lebesgue differentiation theorem with minimal demands on the underlying measure, a maximally smooth approximation to the identity and a Calderon-Zygmund decomposition for distributions. These results are of independent interest. The second part establishes very general criteria guaranteeing that a linear operator acts continuously from a Hardy space into a topological vector space, emphasizing the role of the action of the operator on atoms. Applications include the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for elliptic systems in the upper-half space with boundary data from Hardy spaces. The tools established in the first part are then used to develop a sharp theory of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces in Ahlfors-regular quasi-metric spaces.

Presenting a study of geometric action functionals (i.e., non-negative functionals on the space of unparameterized oriented rectifiable curves), this monograph focuses on the subclass of those functionals whose local action is a degenerate type of Finsler metric that may vanish in certain directions, allowing for curves with positive Euclidean length but with zero action. For such functionals, criteria are developed under which there exists a minimum action curve leading from one given set to another. Then the properties of this curve are studied, and the non-existence of minimizers is established in some settings. Applied to a geometric reformulation of the quasipotential of Wentzell-Freidlin theory (a subfield of large deviation theory), these results can yield the existence and properties of maximum likelihood transition curves between two metastable states in a stochastic process with small noise.

This course-based primer offers readers a concise introduction to the description of quantum mechanical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom - and quantum spin systems in particular - using the operator algebraic approach. Here, the observables are modeled using elements of some operator algebra, usually a C*-algebra. This text introduces readers to the framework and the necessary mathematical tools without assuming much mathematical background, making it more accessible than advanced monographs. The book also highlights the usefulness of the so-called thermodynamic limit of quantum spin systems, which is the limit of infinite system size. For example, this makes it possible to clearly distinguish between local and global properties, without having to keep track of the system size. Together with Lieb-Robinson bounds, which play a similar role in quantum spin systems to that of the speed of light in relativistic theories, this approach allows ideas from relativistic field theories to be implemented in a quantum spin system. Several related cases are discussed, demonstrating the merits of the operator algebraic approach. Featuring representative worked-out examples and many exercises, this text is primarily targeted at graduate students and advanced undergraduates in theoretical physics or mathematics with a keen interest in mathematical physics. The material provides the necessary background and pointers to start exploring the recent literature.

The author contextualizes their accomplishments in light of the political and cultural climate, from the Cold War in the background to the changing status of women in society at large, during the Seventies. The book includes the biographies of, and in some cases interviews with, the sixty women who flew in space in the first half century of space history. It reports their achievements and some little known details. The result is a gallery of pioneering women who reached for the stars: women who, with exceptional skill, hard work, and dedication, reached impressive careers as accomplished pilots, researchers, and engineers; many are now in high level managerial positions both at NASA or in public and private organizations, and all left a legacy of strength.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1657561151", "content": {"text": "Predictability of Chaotic Dynamics : A Finite-time Lyapunov Exponents Approach. This book is primarily concerned with the computational aspects of predictability of dynamical systems – in particular those where observation, modeling and computation are strongly interdependent. Unlike with physical systems under control in laboratories, for instance in celestial mechanics, one is confronted with the observation and modeling of systems without the possibility of altering the key parameters of the objects studied. Therefore, the numerical simulations offer an essential tool for analyzing these systems. With the widespread use of computer simulations to solve complex dynamical systems, the reliability of the numerical calculations is of ever-increasing interest and importance. This reliability is directly related to the regularity and instability properties of the modeled flow. In this interdisciplinary scenario, the underlying physics provide the simulated models, nonlinear dynamics provides their chaoticity and instability properties, and the computer sciences provide the actual numerical implementation. This book introduces and explores precisely this link between the models and their predictability characterization based on concepts derived from the field of nonlinear dynamics, with a focus on the finite-time Lyapunov exponents approach. The method is illustrated using a number of well-known continuous dynamical systems, including the Contopoulos, Hénon-Heiles and Rössler systems. To help students and newcomers quickly learn to apply these techniques, the appendix provides descriptions of the algorithms used throughout the text and details how to implement them in order to solve a given continuous dynamical system.

Preface -- Notation -- General Outline -- Quantum Mechanics -- Free Scalar Fields.-Interacting Scalar Fields -- Fermions -- Gauge Fields -- Low-Energy Effective Field Theories -- Finite Density -- Real-Time Observables -- Applications -- Index. This book presents thermal field theory techniques, which can be applied in both cosmology and the theoretical description of the QCD plasma generated in heavy-ion collision experiments. It focuses on gauge interactions (whether weak or strong), which are essential in both contexts. As well as the many differences in the physics questions posed and in the microscopic forces playing a central role, the authors also explain the similarities and the techniques, such as the resummations, that are needed for developing a formally consistent perturbative expansion. The formalism is developed step by step, starting from quantum mechanics; introducing scalar, fermionic and gauge fields; describing the issues of infrared divergences; resummations and effective field theories; and incorporating systems with finite chemical potentials. With this machinery in place, the important class of real-time (dynamic) observables is treated in some detail. This is followed by an overview of a number of applications, ranging from the study of phase transitions and particle production rate computations, to the concept of transport and damping coefficients that play a ubiquitous role in current developments.

The exposition style follows the Hungarian mathematical tradition of Paul Erdős and others. The order of the first two parts, functional analysis and the Lebesgue integral, may be reversed. In the third and final part they are combined to study various spaces of continuous and integrable functions. Several beautiful, but almost forgotten, classical theorems are also included.

Wages are the main determinant of living standards for the vast majority of workers and families around the world. This manual describes a new methodology to measure what constitutes a decent but basic standard of living and how much workers need to earn to afford this, making it possible for researchers to estimate comparable living wages around the world and determine gaps between living wages and prevailing wages. The new, practical methodology in this manual draws on 10 years of research and experience to clearly explain each step in the estimation process, based on standards for a low-cost nutritious diet, healthy housing, and all other needs including decent health care and children's education. It stresses transparency and the need for time- and place-specific living wage estimates, and is replete with examples from country studies that have put it to the test. The authors describe how living wages can be estimated in locations and countries where secondary data are limited and make new, practical recommendations on how to value in kind benefits as partial payment of a living wage An essential tool for global sustainability standards, researchers, NGOs, governments and international organizations interested in wages, estimating realistic poverty lines, formulating policies for reducing poverty and income inequality, and improving livelihoods and international trade agreements.

The intervening years have also shown which advances are of most use. This self-contained book covers topics from the previous publications, while also including recent developments in method, software and application. Distance sampling refers to a suite of methods, including line and point transect sampling, in which animal density or abundance is estimated from a sample of distances to detected individuals. The book illustrates these methods through case studies; data sets and computer code are supplied to readers through the book’s accompanying website. Some of the case studies use the software Distance, while others use R code. The book is in three parts. The first part addresses basic methods, the design of surveys, distance sampling experiments, field methods and data issues. The second part develops a range of modelling approaches for distance sampling data.

This book starts with a discussion of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, bifurcation theory and Hamiltonian dynamics. It then embarks on a systematic discussion of the traditional topics of modern nonlinear dynamics -- integrable systems, Poincaré maps, chaos, fractals and strange attractors. The Baker’s transformation, the logistic map and Lorenz system are discussed in detail in view of their central place in the subject. There is a detailed discussion of solitons centered around the Korteweg-deVries equation in view of its central place in integrable systems. Then, there is a discussion of the Painlevé property of nonlinear differential equations which seems to provide a test of integrability. Finally, there is a detailed discussion of the application of fractals and multi-fractals to fully-developed turbulence -- a problem whose understanding has been considerably enriched by the application of the concepts and methods of modern nonlinear dynamics. On the application side, there is a special emphasis on some aspects of fluid dynamics and plasma physics reflecting the author’s involvement in these areas of physics. A few exercises have been provided that range from simple applications to occasional considerable extension of the theory. This book has grown out of the author’s lecture notes for an interdisciplinary graduate-level course on nonlinear dynamics. The basic concepts, language and results of nonlinear dynamical systems are described in a clear and coherent way. In order to allow for an interdisciplinary readership, an informal style has been adopted and the mathematical formalism has been kept to a minimum. This book is addressed to first-year graduate students in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, and is useful also to any theoretically inclined researcher in the physical sciences and engineering.

This book evaluates and suggests potentially critical improvements to causal set theory, one of the best-motivated approaches to the outstanding problems of fundamental physics. Spacetime structure is of central importance to physics beyond general relativity and the standard model. The causal metric hypothesis treats causal relations as the basis of this structure. The book develops the consequences of this hypothesis under the assumption of a fundamental scale, with smooth spacetime geometry viewed as emergent. This approach resembles causal set theory, but differs in important ways; for example, the relative viewpoint, emphasizing relations between pairs of events, and relationships between pairs of histories, is central. The book culminates in a dynamical law for quantum spacetime, derived via generalized path summation.

This book presents the first comprehensive, interdisciplinary review of the rapidly developing field of air lasing. In most applications of lasers, such as cutting and engraving, the laser source is brought to the point of service where the laser beam is needed to perform its function. However, in some important applications such as remote atmospheric sensing, placing the laser at a convenient location is not an option. Current sensing schemes rely on the detection of weak backscattering of ground-based, forward-propagating optical probes, and possess limited sensitivity. The concept of air lasing (or atmospheric lasing) relies on the idea that the constituents of the air itself can be used as an active laser medium, creating a backward-propagating, impulsive, laser-like radiation emanating from a remote location in the atmosphere.

This review is the first in a new series on the skills and labour market integration of immigrants and their children. With 16% of its population born abroad, Sweden has one of the larger immigrant populations among the European OECD countries. Estimates suggest that about half of the foreign-born population originally came to Sweden as refugees or as the family of refugees and Sweden has been the OECD country that has had by far the largest inflows of asylum seekers relative to its population. In all OECD countries, humanitarian migrants and their families face greater challenges to integrate into the labour market than other groups. It is thus not surprising that immigrant versus native-born differences are larger than elsewhere, which also must be seen in the context of high skills and labour market participation among the native-born. For both genders, employment disparities are particularly pronounced among the low-educated, among whom immigrants are heavily overrepresented. These immigrants face particular challenges related to the paucity of low-skilled jobs in Sweden, and policy needs to acknowledge that their integration pathway tends to be a long one. Against this backdrop, Sweden has highly developed and longstanding integration policies that mainly aim at upskilling immigrants while temporarily lowering the cost of hiring, while other tools that work more strongly with the social partners and the civil society are less well developed and need strengthening.", "title_en": "Working Together: Skills and Labour Market Integration of Immigrants and their Children in Sweden"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4027238-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5157-3", "year": "2016", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

It provides both a conceptual and a technical foundation for the understanding and analysis of problems arising in biology and physiology. The theory and methods is illustrated on a wide range of examples and applications. A process of extreme complexity, growth plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and is considered to be the hallmark of life itself. Its description has been one of the fundamental problems of life sciences, but until recently, it has not attracted much attention from mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. The author herein presents the first major technical monograph on the problem of growth since D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson’s 1917 book On Growth and Form. The emphasis of the book is on the proper mathematical formulation of growth kinematics and mechanics. Accordingly, the discussion proceeds in order of complexity and the book is divided into five parts. First, a general introduction on the problem of growth from a historical perspective is given. Then, basic concepts are introduced within the context of growth in filamentary structures. These ideas are then generalized to surfaces and membranes and eventually to the general case of volumetric growth. The book concludes with a discussion of open problems and outstanding challenges.

The emergence of these patterns in molecular structures provides a variety of information on their structural properties and plays a significant part in energy transfer processes, topological defects, dislocations, and related structure transitions. Real media, in which solitons take the form of solitary waves, are also considered. In this context, the formation of nonlinear waves in a continuous medium described by nonlinear equations is associated with spontaneous breaking of the local symmetry of the homogeneous system, which produces a range of interesting phenomena.

While the Standard Model of Particle Physics is incredibly successful in describing the known universe it is, nevertheless, an incomplete theory with many free parameters and open issues. An elegant solution to all of these quandaries is the proposed theory of SUSY GUTs. In a GUT, quarks and leptons are related in a simple way by the unifying symmetry and their electric charges are quantized, further the relative strength of the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces are predicted. SUSY GUTs additionally provide a framework for understanding particle masses and offer candidates for dark matter. Finally, with the extension of SUSY GUTs to string theory, a quantum-mechanically consistent unification of the four known forces (including gravity) is obtained. The book is organized in three sections: the first section contains a brief introduction to the Standard Model, supersymmetry and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Then SUSY GUTs in four space-time dimensions are introduced and reviewed. In addition, the cosmological issues concerning SUSY GUTs are discussed. Then the requirements for embedding a 4D SUSY GUT into higher-dimensional theories including gravity (i.e. String Theory) are investigated. Accordingly, section two of the course is devoted to discussing the so-called Orbifold GUTs and how in turn they solve some of the technical problems of 4D SUSY GUTs.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1659121744", "content": {"text": "Variational Approach to Gravity Field Theories : From Newton to Einstein and Beyond. This book offers a detailed and stimulating account of the Lagrangian, or variational, approach to general relativity and beyond. The approach more usually adopted when describing general relativity is to introduce the required concepts of differential geometry and derive the field and geodesic equations from purely geometrical properties. Demonstration of the physical meaning then requires the weak field approximation of these equations to recover their Newtonian counterparts. The potential downside of this approach is that it tends to suit the mathematical mind and requires the physicist to study and work in a completely unfamiliar environment. In contrast, the approach to general relativity described in this book will be especially suited to physics students. After an introduction to field theories and the variational approach, individual sections focus on the variational approach in relation to special relativity, general relativity, and alternative theories of gravity.

Accounting for the astonishing developments in the field of Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, this second edition has been updated and substantially expanded. Starting with the description of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, this cogently written textbook introduces the reader to the astronomy of galaxies, their structure, active galactic nuclei, evolution and large scale distribution in the Universe. After an extensive and thorough introduction to modern observational and theoretical cosmology, the focus turns to the formation of structures and astronomical objects in the early Universe. The basics of classical astronomy and stellar astrophysics needed for extragalactic astronomy are provided in the appendix. The new edition incorporates some of the most spectacular results from new observatories like the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Herschel, ALMA, WMAP and Planck, as well as new instruments and multi-wavelength campaigns which have expanded our understanding of the Universe and the objects populating it. This includes new views on the galaxy population in the nearby Universe, on elliptical galaxies, as well as a deeper view of the distant Universe approaching the dark ages, and an unprecedented view of the distant dusty Universe. Schneider also discusses the impressive support for the standard model of the Universe, which has been substantially strengthened by recent results, including baryon acoustic oscillations (an approach which has significantly matured over the years), results from the completed WMAP mission and from the first Planck results, which have confirmed and greatly improved on these findings, not least by measuring the gravitational lensing effect on the microwave background. Further, a new chapter focusing on galaxy evolution illustrates how well the observations of distant galaxies and their central supermassive black holes can be understood in a general framework of theoretical ideas, models, and numerical simulations. Peter Schneider’s Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology offers fundamental information on this fascinating subfield of astronomy, while leading readers to the forefront of astronomical research.

To see objects that live in the fourth dimension we humans would need to add a fourth dimension to our three-dimensional vision. An example of such an object that lives in the fourth dimension is a hyper-sphere or “3-sphere”. The quest to imagine the elusive 3-sphere has deep historical roots: medieval poet Dante Alighieri, in his circa 1300 AD Divine Comedy, used a 3-sphere to convey his allegorical vision of the Christian afterlife. In 1917, Albert Einstein visualized the universe, at each instant in time, as a 3-sphere. He described his representation as “…the place where the reader’s imagination boggles. Nobody can imagine this thing.” Over time, however, our understanding of the concept of dimension evolved. By 2003, a researcher had successfully rendered into human vision the structure of a 4-web (think of an every increasingly-dense spider’s web). In this text Stephen Lipscomb takes his innovative dimension theory research a step further, using the 4-web to reveal a new partial image of a 3-sphere. Illustrations support the reader’s understanding of the mathematics behind this process. Lipscomb describes a computer program that can produce partial images of a 3-sphere and suggests methods of discerning other fourth-dimensional objects that may serve as the basis for future artwork. Reviews The author’s notion of fractal-based computer art is fascinating-a clear expression of our technological age. With the color plates in this book and the available DVD animation the reader will not only substantiate this, but will also gain an intuitive sense about the nature of fractals and about the structure and origin of the 4-web. A.D. Parks, Ph.D., Principal Scientist, Head of Quantum Physics Group, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Virginia Using numerous illustrations, the author discusses the idea of a fourth dimension. The new feature here is his use of an object that up until recently lived only in the fourth dimension. This book should become useful, educational, and widely-read.

In particular, new proofs of the strong law of large numbers and the Hajek-Renyi inequality are detailed. Applications of the described theory include Gibbs fields, spin glasses, polymer models, image analysis and random shapes. Limit theorems form the backbone of probability theory and statistical theory alike. The theory of multiple sums of random variables is a direct generalization of the classical study of limit theorems, whose importance and wide application in science is unquestionable. However, to date, the subject of multiple sums has only been treated in journals. The results described in this book will be of interest to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers who work on limit theorems in probability theory, the statistical analysis of random fields, as well as in the field of random sets or stochastic geometry. The central topic is also important for statistical theory, developing statistical inferences for random fields, and also has applications to the sciences, including physics and chemistry", "title_en": "Limit Theorems for Multi-Indexed Sums of Random Variables"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4158163-5", "gnd:4205983-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Klesov, Oleg", "year": "2014", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This book presents the basics and advanced topics of research of gamma ray physics. It describes measuring of Fermi surfaces with gamma resonance spectroscopy and the theory of angular distributions of resonantly scattered gamma rays. The dependence of excited-nuclei average lifetime on the shape of the exciting-radiation spectrum and electron binding energies in the spectra of scattered gamma rays is described. Resonant excitation by gamma rays of nuclear isomeric states with long lifetime leads to the emission and absorption lines. In the book, a new gamma spectroscopic method, gravitational gamma spectrometry, is developed. It has a resolution hundred million times higher than the usual Mössbauer spectrometer. Another important topic of this book is resonant scattering of annihilation quanta by nuclei with excited states in connection with positron annihilation. The application of the methods described is to explain the phenomenon of Coulomb fragmentation of gamma-source molecules and resonant scattering of annihilation quanta to study the shape of Fermi surfaces of metals", "title_en": "Advances in Gamma Ray Resonant Scattering and Absorption : Long-Lived Isomeric Nuclear States"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4177861-3", "gnd:4155924-1", "gnd:4019205-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1060353326", "year": "2015", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This publication focuses on care professionals' health in home care. It examines the impact of preparing and post-processing communication structures on the well-being of employees. Such structures are understood as the totality of formal and informal communication instruments and practices. These include, for example, handoff structures and documentation structures. In order to create a scientific basis for the analysis, an overview of the framework conditions and job requirements in the sector will be given and theoretical principles of stress will be presented. Subsequently, models for the development of stress are applied to preparing and post-processing communication structures. The analysis shows that the design of preparing and post-processing communication structures has an effect on nursing staff's ability to cope with work requirements and thus has a considerable influence on their health. There is a need for action to strengthen resources and minimize stressors - for example in the area of social support through personal communication. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that nursing staff should be involved in the design of structures. Finally, possible effects of the investigated structures will be worked out on individual as well as on social level to show the importance of the topic. Im Zentrum dieser Veröffentlichung steht die Gesundheit der Pflegenden in der ambulanten Pflege. Es wird untersucht, welchen Einfluss die Gestaltung von Kommunikationsstrukturen der Arbeitsvor- und -nachbereitung auf das Wohlbefinden der Beschäftigten hat.

In situations where such sensing provides reliable measurement, this is clearly the ideal method (see Chapter 2), but this approach has limitations,and particularly so in the context of microscopy. In order to understand this, one should consider the constraints the use of a wavefront sensor places on the nature of the optical conguration. A wavefront is only well de ned in particular situations, for example when light is emitted by a small or distant, point-like object, such as a star for a telescope or a minuscule bead in a microscope. In these situations, a wavefront sensor provides a clear and reliable measurement and this phenomenon has been used to great effect, as explained in Chapter 2. However, not all sources of light have these necessary properties. For example, a large luminous object comprises an arrangement of individual emitters, each of which produces its associated wavefront. In this case, a wavefront sensor would respond to all of the light impinging upon it, thus giving potentially ambiguous measurements. In an extreme case, such as where light is emitted throughout the volume of the specimen, the sensor would be swamped with light and thus be un-able to provide sensible aberration measurement. For this reason, in microscopy, direct wavefront sensing has been e ective where point-like sources have been employed, either through the introduction of uorescent beads [1, 2], or using localised uorescent markers [3] and non-linear excited guide stars [4, 5, 6]\"--Provided by publisher", "title_en": "Wavefront shaping for biomedical imaging"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4006684-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2019", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Measuring innovation in education and understanding how it works is essential to improve the quality of the education sector. Monitoring systematically how pedagogical practices evolve would considerably increase the international education knowledge base. We need to examine whether, and how, practices are changing within classrooms and educational organisations and how students use learning resources. We should know much more about how teachers change their professional development practices, how schools change their ways to relate to parents, and, more generally, to what extent change and innovation are linked to better educational outcomes. This would help policy makers to better target interventions and resources, and get quick feedback on whether reforms do change educational practices as expected. This would enable us to better understand the role of innovation in education. This new edition of Measuring Innovation in Education examines what has (or has not) changed for students over the past decade in OECD education systems. It reviews no fewer than 150 educational practices. The report casts light on systemic innovation in primary and secondary education, with a focus on pedagogical innovation. Has the use of technology spread? Have assessments become more important in pedagogical practices? Are students given more agency in their learning? Are they still asked to memorise facts and procedures? Do teachers increasingly engage students in peer learning activities? These are some of the questions this book seeks to answer. This report also presents some preliminary findings about the links between innovation and educational performance. This book will offer precious insights to policy makers, the education community and all those who seek to understand how educational practices are evolving.", "title_en": "Measuring innovation in education 2019 : what has changed in the classroom?"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4027089-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Jacotin, Gwénaël; Kar, Soumyajit; Vincent-Lancrin, Stéphan", "year": "2019", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Over the timespan of just one generation the planet's pace of urbanization has dramatically increased. Through these dynamics and its resulting environmental threats, new challenges have emerged that deeply question the validity of the post-war planning paradigms. Dominant ideologies have been replaced by a problem-solving attitude, increased economic pressure and an urgent quest for evidence. What impact does this have on the work of the urban designer and planner, and how can the profession prepare for the future? 'Designing Change' tries to answer these and many other questions through in-depth conversations with 12 leading practitioners in the field : Christopher Choa (AECOM), Bruno Fortier (Agence Bruno Fortier), Finn Geipel (LIN) Adriaan Geuze (West 8), Djamel Klouche (AUC), Winy Maas (MVRDV) Dennis Pieprz (Sasaki Associates), Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk (DPZ), Albert Speer (AS+P) with Michael Denkel, Paola Viganò (Studio Paola Viganò), Liu Xiaodu (Urbanus) with Wang Hui, Wenyi Zhu (ZhuWenyi-Atelier).

There are even concerns, reflected in many science fiction films, that robots may eventually become competitors with humans for survival. This book looks at both the history of robots, in science and in fiction, as well as the science behind robots. Specific chapters analyse the impact of robots on the labour market, people's attitudes to robots, the impact of robots on society, and the appropriate policies to pursue to prepare our world for the robot revolution. Overall the book strikes a cautionary tone. Robots will change our world dramatically and they will also change human beings. These important issues are examined from the perspective of an economist, but the book is intended to appeal to a wider audience in the social sciences and beyond", "title_en": "The robot revolution : understanding the social and economic impact"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4050208-9", "gnd:4033447-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:170481549", "year": "2019", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

In 2012, whilst working at the Royal Horticultural Society's library, Fiona Davison unearthed a collection of handwritten letters that dated back to 1822. The letters, each carefully set out in neat copperplate writing, had been written by young gardeners in support of their application to be received into the Society's Garden. Amongst them was a letter from the young Joseph Paxton, who would go on to become one of Britain's best-known gardeners and architects. But he was far from alone in shaping the way we garden today and now, for the first time, the stories of the young, working-class men who also played a central role in the history of British horticulture can be told.0Using their letters, Fiona Davison traces the stories of a handful of these forgotten gardeners whose lives would take divergent paths to create a unique history of gardening. The trail took her from Chiswick to Bolivia and uncovered tales of fraud, scandal and madness - and, of course, a large number of fabulous plants and gardens. This is a celebration of the unsung heroes of horticulture whose achievements reflect a golden moment in British gardening, and continue to influence how we garden today --", "title_en": "The hidden horticulturists : the untold story of the men who shaped Britain's gardens"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4019311-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1306691818", "year": "2019", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Fractured bedrock aquifers have traditionally been regarded as low-productivity aquifers, with only limited relevance to regional groundwater resources. It is now being increasingly recognised that these complex bedrock aquifers can play an important role in catchment management and subsurface energy systems. At shallow to intermediate depth, fractured bedrock aquifers help to sustain surface water baseflows and groundwater dependent ecosystems, provide local groundwater supplies and impact on contaminant transfers on a catchment scale. At greater depths, understanding the properties and groundwater flow regimes of these complex aquifers can be crucial for the successful installation of subsurface energy and storage systems, such as deep geothermal or Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage systems and natural gas or CO2 storage facilities as well as the exploration of natural resources such as conventional/unconventional oil and gas. In many scenarios, a robust understanding of fractured bedrock aquifers is required to assess the nature and extent of connectivity between such engineered subsurface systems at depth and overlying receptors in the shallow subsurface", "title_en": "Groundwater in fractured bedrock environments : managing catchment and subsurface resources"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4225478-4", "gnd:4132395-6", "gnd:4480861-6", "gnd:4022369-3", "gnd:4522007-4", "gnd:4198409-2", "gnd:4121396-8", "gnd:4026307-1", "gnd:4163107-9", "gnd:4140673-4", "gnd:4143413-4", "gnd:4022375-9", "gnd:4026288-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2019", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Smarter cities will bring in new revenue while saving money. They will be more of everything that a twenty-first century urban planner, citizen, and elected official wants: more efficient, more sustainable, and more inclusive. Is this true? In Uneven Innovation, Jennifer Clark considers the potential of these emerging technologies as well as their capacity to exacerbate existing inequalities and even produce new ones. She reframes the smart city concept within the trajectory of uneven development of cities and regions, as well as the long history of technocratic solutions to urban policy challenges. Clark argues that urban change driven by the technology sector is following the patterns that have previously led to imbalanced access, opportunities, and outcomes. The tech sector needs the city, yet it exploits and maintains unequal arrangements, embedding labor flexibility and precarity in the built environment. Technology development, Uneven Innovation contends, is the easy part; understanding the city and its governance, regulation, access, participation, and representation-all of which are complex and highly localized-is the real challenge.

This book represents the first comprehensive review of a different type of super-resolved microscopy, which does not rely on using fluorescent markers. Such label-free super-resolution microscopy enables potentially even broader applications in life sciences and nanoscale imaging, but is much more challenging and it is based on different physical concepts and approaches. A unique feature of this book is that it combines insights into mechanisms of label-free super-resolution with a vast range of applications from fast imaging of living cells to inorganic nanostructures.

Billed as the Pittsburgh Renaissance, this era of superlatives–the city claimed the tallest aluminum clad building, the world’s largest retractable dome, the tallest steel structure–developed through visionary mayors and business leaders, powerful urban planning authorities, and architects and urban designers of international renown, including Frank Lloyd Wright, I.M.

Recently, historiography has increasingly emphasized how France’s overseas colonies also influenced the contours of the French Revolution.

It departs from the assumption that revolutions shatter not only the political and economic old regime order at home but, in an increasingly interdependent world, also result in processes of respatialization.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1678402672", "content": {"text": "How nations learn : technological learning, industrial policy, and catch-up. Authored by eminent scholars, the volume aims to generate interest and debate among policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on the complexity of learning and catch-up, particularly for twenty-first century late-late developers. The volume explores technological learning at the firm level, policy learning by the state, and the cumulative and multifaceted nature of the learning process, which encompasses learning by doing, by experiment, emulation, innovation, and leapfrogging. Why is catch-up rare? And why have some nations succeeded while others failed? What are the prospects for successful learning and catch-up in the twenty-first century? These are pertinent questions that require further research and in-depth analysis. The World Bank estimates that out of the 101 middle-income economies in 1960, only thirteen became high income by 2008. This volume examines how nations learn by reviewing key structural and contingent factors that contribute to dynamic learning and catch-up. Rejecting both the one-size-fits-all approach and the agnosticism that all nations are unique and different, the volume uses historical as well as firm-level, industry-level, and country-level evidence and experiences to identify the sources and drivers of successful learning and catch-up and the lessons for late-latecomer countries. Building on the latecomer-advantage perspective, the volume shows that what is critical for dynamic learning and catch-up is not learning per se but the intensity of learning, robust industrial policies, and the pace and direction of learning. Equally important are the passion to learn, long-term strategic vision, and understanding the context in which successful learning occurs.", "title_en": "How nations learn : technological learning, industrial policy, and catch-up"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4059277-7", "gnd:4474645-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2019", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Spatial justice has been central to urban theorists in various ways. Intimately connected to social justice, it is a term implicated in relations of power which concern the spatial distribution of resources, rights and materials. Arguably there can be no notion of social justice that is not spatial. Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos has argued that spatial justice is the struggle of various bodies - human, natural, non-organic, technological - to occupy a certain space at a certain time. As such, urban planning and policy interventions are always, to some extent at least, about spatial justice. And, as cities become ever more unequal, it is crucial that urbanists address questions of spatial justice in the city. To this end, this book considers these questions from a range of disciplinary perspectives. Crossing law, sociology, history, cultural studies and geography, the book's overarching concern with how to think spatial justice in the city brings a fresh perspective to issues that have concerned urbanists for several decades. The inclusion of empirical work in London brings the political, social, and cultural aspects of spatial justice to life\"--", "title_en": "Spatial justice in the city"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4120814-6", "gnd:4056723-0", "gnd:4172385-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2020", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

These unprecedented recent advances in UAV technology have made it possible to widely deploy drones across a plethora of application domains ranging from delivery of goods to surveillance, environmental monitoring, track control, remote sensing, and search and rescue. In fact, recent reports from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) anticipate that sales of UAVs may exceed 7 million in 2020 and many industries are currently investing in innovative drone-centric applications and research. To enable all such applications, it is imperative to address a plethora of research challenges pertaining to drone systems, ranging from navigation to autonomy, control, sensing, navigation, and communications. In particular, the deployment of UAVs in tomorrow's smart cities, is largely contingent upon equipping them with effective means for communications and networking. To this end, in this book, we provide a comprehensive treatment of the wireless communications and networking research challenges and opportunities associated with UAV technology.

This book lays out the theory of Mordell-Weil lattices, a very powerful and influential tool at the crossroads of algebraic geometry and number theory, which offers many fruitful connections to other areas of mathematics. The book presents all the ingredients entering into the theory of Mordell-Weil lattices in detail, notably, relevant portions of lattice theory, elliptic curves, and algebraic surfaces. After defining Mordell-Weil lattices, the authors provide several applications in depth. They start with the classification of rational elliptic surfaces. Then a useful connection with Galois representations is discussed. By developing the notion of excellent families, the authors are able to design many Galois representations with given Galois groups such as the Weyl groups of E6, E7 and E8. They also explain a connection to the classical topic of the 27 lines on a cubic surface. Two chapters deal with elliptic K3 surfaces, a pulsating area of recent research activity which highlights many central properties of Mordell-Weil lattices. Finally, the book turns to the rank problem--one of the key motivations for the introduction of Mordell-Weil lattices. The authors present the state of the art of the rank problem for elliptic curves both over Q and over C(t) and work out applications to the sphere packing problem.

At Harvard University, he pioneered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, used in chemistry and biology for structure identification; moreover leading to MRI), laser theory and nonlinear optics. In 1978 he was awarded the Lorentz Medal for his contribution to the theory of nonlinear optics (used in fiber optics), and in 1981 he received the Nobel Prize for physics, along with Arthur Schawlow and Kai Siegbahn. The book is based on numerous conversations with Nicolaas Bloembergen himself, his wife Deli Brink, his family, and colleagues in science. It describes his childhood and study in Bilthoven and Utrecht, the first postwar years at Harvard, the discoveries of masers and lasers, and the award of the Nobel Prize.

This accessible introduction to modern theories of enzyme catalysis presents the latest methods for studying quantum tunnelling in biological systems, In recent years, there has been an explosion in knowledge and research associated with the field of enzyme catalysis and H-tunneling. Rich in its breath and depth, this introduction to modern theories and methods of study is suitable for experienced researchers those new to the subject. Edited by two leading experts, and bringing together the foremost practitioners in the field, this up-to-date account of a rapidly developing field sits at the interface between biology, chemistry and physics. It covers computational, kinetic and structural analysis of tunnelling and the synergy in combining these methods (with a major focus on H-tunneling reactions in enzyme systems). The book starts with a brief overview of proton and electron transfer history by Nobel Laureate, Rudolph A. Marcus. The reader is then guided through chapters covering almost every aspect of reactions in enzyme catalysis ranging from descriptions of the relevant quantum theory and quantum/classical theoretical methodology to the description of experimental results. The theoretical interpretation of these large systems includes both quantum mechanical and statistical mechanical computations, as well as simple more approximate models. Most of the chapters focus on enzymatic catalysis of hydride, proton and H\" transfer, an example of the latter being proton coupled electron transfer. There is also a chapter on electron transfer in proteins. This is timely since the theoretical framework developed fifty years ago for treating electron transfers has now been adapted to H-transfers and electron transfers in proteins. Accessible in style, this book is suitable for a wide audience but will be particularly useful to advanced level undergraduates, postgraduates and early postdoctoral workers", "title_en": "Quantum tunnelling in enzyme-catalysed reactions"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4176595-3", "gnd:4393622-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2009", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The idea of 'teleconnection', borrowed from the geosciences, describes the influence of atmospheric circulation patterns often over long distances. It seems that there were 'teleconnections' in society, too. So this volumes aims to examine man-environment interactions mainly in the 14th century from all over Europe and beyond. It integrates contributions from different disciplines on impact, perception and reaction of environmental change and natural extreme events on late Medieval societies.

Future Trends of Emulsifiers and Other Food Ingredients Emulsifiers, also known as surfactants, are often added to processed foods to improve stability, texture, or shelf life. These additives are regulated by national agencies, such as the FDA, or multi-national authorities, such as the EEC or WHO. The amphiphilic molecules function by assisting the dispersion of mutually insoluble phases and stabilizing the resulting colloids, emulsions, and foams. Emulsifiers can interact with other food components such as carbohydrates, proteins, water, and ions to produce complexes and mesophases. These interactions may enhance or disrupt structures and affect functional properties of finished foods. In dairy processing, small molecule emulsifiers may displace dairy proteins from oil/water and air/water interfaces, which affects stability and properties of the foams and emulsions. In baked products, emulsifiers contribute to secondary functionalities, such as dough strengthening and anti-staling. Synthetic food emulsifiers suffer from the stigma of chemical names on a product’s ingredient statement. Modern consumers are seeking products that are “all natural.” Fortunately, there are a number of natural ingredients that are surface-active, such as lecithin, milk proteins, and some protein-containing hydrocolloids. Mayonnaise, for example, is stabilized by egg yolk.

Riven with scientific uncertainty, contending interests, and competing interpretations, climate change today poses an existential challenge. For India, such a challenge is compounded by the immediate concerns of eradicating poverty and accelerating development. Moreover, India has played a relatively limited role thus far in causing the problem. Despite these complicating factors, India has to engage this challenge because a pathway to development innocent of climate change is no longer possible. To do so requires stimulating conversation on climate change as part of India’s larger development discourse. This volume brings together leading researchers and practitioners—negotiators, activists, and policymakers—to lay out the emergent debate on climate change in India. Through these chapters, the contributors hope to deepen clarity both on why India should engage with climate change and how it can best do so, even while appreciating and representing the challenges inherent in doing so.", "title_en": "India in a warming world : integrating climate change and development"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4164199-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2019", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Rheology of Semisolid Foods comprehensively covers the rheological behaviors and rheological testing of semisolid foods. Individual chapters focus on semisolid food structure, rheological and sensory behaviors, testing of various semisolid food behaviors, and factors that impact those behaviors. Special concentration is given to the relationships among semisolid food structures and mechanical properties and textures. The second section of this work presents a series of case studies on acid milk gels and yogurt which provide a practical illustration of the concepts presented in the preceding chapters, allowing readers to gain both conceptual knowledge of semisolid food rheology and an understanding of how that knowledge can be applied to a food system of choice. Individual components, processing parameters, and storage conditions can dramatically impact food functional properties and textures. Changing any of these factors can cause significant microstructural alterations resulting in undesirable changes in product stability, functionality and texture. The lack of knowledge of how these factors impact the final food properties makes development of new food products a process of empirical trial rather than intentional design.

Finding solutions to real-life problems in an uncertain environment is a difficult and challenging task. As such, this book addresses the solution of uncertain static and dynamic problems based on affine arithmetic approaches. Affine arithmetic is one of the recent developments designed to handle such uncertainties in a different manner which may be useful for overcoming the dependency problem and may compute better enclosures of the solutions. Further, uncertain static and dynamic problems turn into interval and/or fuzzy linear/nonlinear systems of equations and eigenvalue problems, respectively. Accordingly, this book includes newly developed efficient methods to handle the said problems based on the affine and interval/fuzzy approach.

This book presents a mechanistic approach—mathematical modeling—for carrying out dental materials research. This approach allows researchers to go beyond the null hypothesis and obtain a solution that is more general and therefore predictive for conditions other than those considered in a study. Hence it can be used either on its own or to complement the commonly used statistical approach. Through a series of practical problems with wide-ranging application, the reader will be guided on: How to construct a mathematical model for the behavior of dental materials by making informed assumptions of the physical, chemical, or mechanical situation How to simplify the model by making suitable simplifications How to calibrate the model by calculating the values of key parameters using experimental results How to refine the model when there are discrepancies between predictions and experiments Only elementary calculus is required to follow the examples and all the problems can be solved by using MS Excel© spreadsheets. This is an ideal book for dental materials researchers without a strong mathematical background who are interested in applying a more mechanistic approach to their research to give deeper insight into the problem at hand.

Critical voices from civil society (including academia) hold states responsible for making safe journeys impossible for large parts of the world population. Meanwhile, policy-makers argue that border deaths demonstrate the need for restrictive border policies. Statistics are widely (mis)used to support different readings of border deaths. However, the way data is collected, analysed, and disseminated remains largely unquestioned. Similarly, little is known about how bodies are treated, and about the different ways in which the dead - also including the missing and the unidentified - are mourned by familiars and strangers. New concepts and perspectives contribute to highlighting the political nature of border deaths and finding ways to move forward.

The economic impact of universities on regional development can be due to their backward-linkages (e. g. regional employment and demand) on the one hand and their forward linkages (e. g. transfer of knowledge and provision of human capital) on the other hand. Topics of the first chapter in this book are the variety of transfer channels between universities and regions, barriers to and determinants of knowledge transfer as well as governance modes for a successful cooperation between universitiesand their surrounding regions. In recent years, the concept of the so called \"third mission\" of universities (in addition to research and education) is often enhanced by the normative concept of sustainability. From this point of view, universities are also responsible for a sustainable development of society. If politics wants to strengthen universities in this role, this might have significant implications on the higher education system as a whole as well as the strategic missions of university boards. This becomes evident in the empirically definable new structural type of \"engaged universities\". These universities see themselves as agents for sustainable development, especially in their own region, which they treat as a kind of natural laboratory. Referring to case study evidence, the second chapter of this book deals with the contribution of universities to sustainable development.Finally, the book presents research on the unintentional impacts of modern science policy on regional development. The recent shift towards excellence-oriented and merit-based research funding, the bologna reforms and the increased orientation on fostering knowledge networks in innovation policy all have significant spatial impacts. The empirical research of these impacts as well as the evaluation regarding regional development goals are the subject of the contributions in the third chapter of this book. Hochschulen sind unter ökonomischer Perspektive für ihre Standortregionen einerseits als Arbeitgeber und Nachfrager von Interesse, andererseits präsentieren sie sich als Wissensproduzenten, als \"Wissensimporteure\" und als Bereitsteller von Humankapital. Über welche Kanäle Hochschulen und Regionen miteinander verbunden sind, welche Hemmnisse und Erfolgsfaktoren beim Wissenstransfer zu beobachten sind und wie erfolgversprechende Governance-Strukturen zur Steuerung des Zusammenspiels geschaffen werden können - das sind Themen, die in dem vorliegenden Band ausführlich behandelt werden. Zudem wird die \"dritte Aufgabe\" (Third Mission) der Hochschulen und ihre gesellschaftliche Mitverantwortung für eine nachhaltige Regionalentwicklung in diesem Buch debatiert. Damit stellt sich zugleich die Frage, durch welche Veränderungen des Hochschulsystems und des Verhaltens von Hochschulen - etwa im Sinne des empirisch beobachtbaren Strukturtyps der \"engagierten Hochschule\" - diesem Anspruch nachgekommen werden kann. Dieses Thema, wie auch die weitergehende Forderung, Hochschulen als Agenten für eine nachhaltige Entwicklung insbesondere im \"Reallabor\" Region ins Blickfeld zu nehmen, ist ebenfalls Gegenstand von Beiträgen in diesem Band - illustriert anhand von Fallbeispielen. Schließlich erfolgt eine Diskussion der eher unbeabsichtigt induzierten regionalen Wirkungen aktueller Wissenschaftspolitik.

For a TOE, all the phenomena of nature share a subtle underlying commonality and are explainable by a single overarching immutable principle. Reading the past for what it is, is of tremendous value, but so is its reading from the perspective of modern knowledge. Not to judge it for its flaws but to be inspired by its insights. This comparative study of the universe is the spirit of In Search of a Theory of Everything-to physics through philosophy, to the new via the old, and in a balanced way. A relatively \"easier\" analysis of nature, that of a major natural philosopher of antiquity, commences every chapter to fasten the bedrock for the more complex. The transition into the more complicated views of modern physics is gradual and systematic, entwining finely the two, the ancient with the new, the forgotten with the current, by unfolding a history and a philosophy of science, and connecting all the great feats of the mind and time.

For some, it is the creation of value. For others, it is the conception and creation of artefacts. For still others it is fitting things to people. These differences reflect disciplinary values that both overlap and diverge. All involve artefacts: we always design things. Each definition considers people and purpose in some way. Each handles evaluation differently, measuring against aesthetics, craft standards, specifications, sales, usage experiences, or usage outcomes. There are both merits and risks in these differences, without an appropriate balance. Poor balance can result from professions claiming the centre of design for their discipline, marginalising others. Process can also cause imbalance when allocating resources to scheduled stages. Balance is promoted by replacing power centres with power sharing, and divisive processes with integrative progressions. A focus on worth guides design towards worthwhile experiences and outcomes that generously exceed expectations. This book places a worth focus (Wo-Fo) in the context of design progressions that are Balanced, Integrated, and Generous (BIG). BIG and Wo-Fo are symbiotic. Worth provides a focus for generosity.

Experts of fluid dynamics agree that turbulence is nonlinear and nonlocal. Because of a direct correspondence, nonlocality also implies fractionality. Fractional dynamics is the physics related to fractal (geometrical) systems and is described by fractional calculus. Up-to-present, numerous criticisms of linear and local theories of turbulence have been published. Nonlinearity has established itself quite well, but so far only a very small number of general nonlocal concepts and no concrete nonlocal turbulent flow solutions were available. This book presents the first analytical and numerical solutions of elementary turbulent flow problems, mainly based on a nonlocal closure. Considerations involve anomalous diffusion (Lévy flights), fractal geometry (fractal-β, bi-fractal and multi-fractal model) and fractional dynamics. Examples include a new ‘law of the wall’ and a generalization of Kraichnan’s energy-enstrophy spectrum that is in harmony with non-extensive and non-equilibrium thermodynamics (Tsallis thermodynamics) and experiments. Furthermore, the presented theories of turbulence reveal critical and cooperative phenomena in analogy with phase transitions in other physical systems, e.g., binary fluids, para-ferromagnetic materials, etc.; the two phases of turbulence identifying the laminar streaks and coherent vorticity-rich structures. This book is intended, apart from fluids specialists, for researchers in physics, as well as applied and numerical mathematics, who would like to acquire knowledge about alternative approaches involved in the analytical and numerical treatment of turbulence.

As per The United Nations World Water Development Report 2017, on average, globally, over 80% of all wastewater is discharged without treatment. The discharge of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater into the environment results in the pollution of surface water, soil and groundwater. As per WHO, water-related diseases kill around 2.2 million people globally each year, mostly children in developing countries. We need to understand that wastewater is not merely a water management issue - it affects the environment, all living beings, and can have direct impacts on economies. The establishment of UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, reflects the increased attention on water and wastewater treatment issues in the global political agenda. The author of this book is convinced that water reuse is one of the most efficient, cost effective & eco-friendly ways to ensure water resilience. The author also believe that embedding sustainability into wastewater treatment is the best opportunity for industries to drive smarter innovation and efficient wastewater treatment. In order to develop sustainable wastewater treatment, we need to evaluate wastewater treatment systems in a broad sense. Economic aspects, treatment performance, carbon emissions, recycling and social issues are important when evaluating sustainability of a wastewater treatment system and selecting an appropriate system for a given condition.

This book challenges conventional wisdoms both about economic performance and about policies for economic development in African countries. Its starting point is the striking variation in economic performance: unevenness and inequalities form a central fact. The authors highlight not only differences between African countries but also variations within countries, differences often organized around distinctions of gender, class, and ethnic identity. For example, school dropout and neonatal mortality have been reduced, particularly for some classes of women in some areas. Horticultural and agribusiness exports have grown far more rapidly in some countries than others. These variations (and many others) point to opportunities for changing performance, reducing inequalities, learning from other African policy experiences, and escaping the ties of structure and legacies of a colonial past. The book rejects teleological illusions and Eurocentric prejudice, but does pay close attention to the results of policy in more industrialized parts of the world. Seeing the contradictions of capitalism for what they are—fundamental and enduring—may help policy officials protect themselves against the misleading idea that development is likely to be a smooth, linear process, or that it would be were certain impediments removed. The authors criticize a wide range of orthodox and heterodox economists, especially for their cavalier attitude to statistical sources.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1727621190", "content": {"text": "Electronic Materials. Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).The electronic properties of solids have become of increasing importance in the age of information technology. The study of solids and materials, while having originated from the disciplines of physics and chemistry, has evolved independently over the past few decades. The classical treatment of solid-state physics, which emphasized classifications, theories and fundamental physical principles, is no longer able to bridge the gap between materials advances and applications. In particular, the more recent developments in device physics and technology have not necessarily been driven by new concepts in physics or new materials, but rather by the ability of engineers to control crystal structures and properties better via advances in crystal growth and patterning techniques. In many cases, new applications simply arise from the adaption of conventional ideas to interdisciplinary areas. One example is that of recent advances which rely heavily upon the availability of the sub-micron technology developed by the semiconductor industry. Another example is the emergence of nanotechnology. This book aims to bridge the gap between solid-state physics, materials science and electronics. Its objective is to serve as a textbook covering all three areas, but having the ultimate goal of providing an understanding of the operation of devices. To make this book useful to a broad set of readers, the tendency is to treat the more difficult subjects, such as solid-state physics, using fewer mathematics and including worked examples where possible. By using such an approach, it is possible to include not only basic principles, but also the knowledge needed for applications. Keeping the subject matter at the elementary level as far as possible, the first 2 chapters introduce classical theories and address questions as elementary as, what are solids, before moving on to examine crystal structures and the link between crystal structures and materials properties. In the subsequent chapters, solids are examined in the sequence: metals; semiconductors; insulators; magnetic solids; superconductors; light-sensitive solids. Applications are discussed and examined. The last chapter is devoted to solid-state transducers and their applications. Altogether, this makes for a very accessible introduction to the subject matter. Kwok (U. of Victoria) has written a textbook intended to bridge the gap between solid-state physics, materials science, and electronics.

Volume is indexed by Thomson Reuters BCI (WoS).Since the mid-nineties, magnesium-based alloys and compounds have been revisited in the hope that they will yield light functional materials. In this third wave of research and development of magnesium-based hydrogenstorage and thermoelectric materials, new factors have become important in addition to the improvement of their properties and performance. The move to reduce environmental damage requires the assurance of non-toxicity and energy-saving during manufacture. For example, the use of lead or bismuth additions must be avoided. Furthermore, due to the diminishing sources of antimony, tellurium and rare-earth elements, only metallic and non-metallic elements having a large Clerk number should be used for production. In order to compensate for these restraints, nano-technological innovation is urgently required; not only in optimum material design but also in material processing, manufacturing and device production, in order to achieve significant energy and cost savings. This monograph is concerned with the solid-state synthesis of magnesium-based functional alloys and compounds in order to further this third wave of R & D on thermoelectric and hydrogen storage materials. Various magnesium-based alloys and compounds are directly synthesized in order to investigate the effects of grain size, composition, dopants and non-equilibrium states upon the hydrogenstorage behavior and thermoelectric properties.In addition to the application of solid-state synthesis to Mg-based alloys and compounds, the two main mechanisms driving solid-state reaction by intense straining are also discussed.By considering these applications, the importance of solid-state synthesis is made clear to students and researchers in materials science and engineering. Magnesium-based materials are of interest for their thermoelectric and hydrogen storage properties, and Aizawa (materials science and engineering, U. of Toronto) wants to help spark a third wave of research into them by describing solid-state methods for synthesizing alloys and compounds for those purposes. He covers characterizing, measuring, and testing the materials; a range of mechanisms for solid-state synthesis; and synthesizing hydrogen storage alloys, binary thermoelectric compounds, and solid-solution compounds.", "title_en": "Solid-State Synthesis of Magnesium-Based Functional Alloys and Compounds"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4016921-2", "gnd:4168536-2", "gnd:4064784-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Aizawa, Tatsuhiko", "year": "2009", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This work addresses the performance of novel metallic hollow-sphere structures (MHSS) in sandwich panels. Numerical finite-element analyses and experimental tests are described. The first part of the book focuses on the various types of metallic hollow-sphere structure. The influence of morphology, topology, joining technology and material composition upon their mechanical properties is investigated numerically. Uniaxial compressive tests, with adhesively-bonded MHSS, are performed in order to confirm the numerical findings. In addition, the effective thermal conductivities of MHSS are determined. The main focus of the second part of this work is the experimental three-point bend testing of sandwich panels. The sandwich panels are assembled using aluminium facing-sheets which enclose various cellular core materials such as M-Pore® and Alporas® aluminium foams, honeycomb structures and adhesively-bonded MHSS. The flexural stiffness, load-carrying capacity and failure modes are determined by using three-point bending tests. A comparison of the experimental findings permits the evaluation of the performance of various cellular metal cores.An invaluable source of data on this specialised topic. Fiedler (engineering, U. of Avreiro, Portugal) focuses on different types of metallic hollow sphere structures (MHSSs), considering their morphology, topology, joining technology, material composition and mechanical properties. He begins by describing cellular metals, the potential for cellular lightweight structures, and sandwich structures, then proceeds to theoretical foundations in mechanics and heat transfer. He then concentrates on then methodologies, including the finite element method, his experimental methods and test procedures. Using various structures and the aforesaid finite element method, he evaluates several factors, analyzing impact behavior and thermal properties. His findings are interesting and well-supported by illustrations and references. However, he does not include an index.

This book addresses the confinement problem, which concerns the behavior of non-abelian gauge theories, and the force which is mediated by gauge fields, at large distances. The word “confinement” in the context of hadronic physics originally referred to the fact that quarks and gluons appear to be trapped inside mesons and baryons, from which they cannot escape. There are other, and possibly deeper meanings that can be attached to the term, and these will be explored in this book. Although the confinement problem is far from solved, much is now known about the general features of the confining force, and there are a number of very well motivated theories of confinement which are under active investigation. This volume gives a both pedagogical and concise introduction and overview of the main ideas in this field, their attractive features, and, as appropriate, their shortcomings. This second edition summarizes some of the developments in this area which have occurred since the first edition of this book appeared in 2011. These include new results in the caloron/dyon picture of confinement, in functional approaches, and in studies of the Yang-Mills vacuum wave functional. Special attention, in two new chapters, is given to recent numerical investigations of the center vortex theory, and to the varieties of confinement which may exist in gauge-Higgs theories.

Milestones -- Superradiance in Flat Spacetime -- Superradiance in Black-Hole Physics -- Black Holes and Superradiant Instabilities -- Black Hole Superradiance in Astrophysics -- Conclusions and Outlook. This book focuses on one mechanism in black hole physics which has proven to be universal, multifaceted and with a rich phenomenology: rotational superradiance. This is an energy extraction process, whereby black holes can deposit their rotational energy in their surroundings, leading to Penrose processes, black-hole bombs, and even Hawking radiation. Black holes are key players in star formation mechanisms and as engines to some of the most violent events in our universe. Their simplicity and compactness make them perfect laboratories, ideally suited to probe new fields or modifications to the theory of gravity. Thus, black holes can also be used to probe some of the most important open problems in physics, including the nature of dark matter or the strong CP problem in particle physics. This monograph is directed to researchers and graduate students and provides a unified view of the subject, covering the theoretical machinery, experimental efforts in the laboratory, and astrophysics searches. It is focused on recent developments and works out a number of novel examples and applications, ranging from fundamental physics to astrophysics. Non-specialists with a scientific background should also find this text a valuable resource for understanding the critical issues of contemporary research in black-hole physics.

Impact of global warming on society and environment; issues and solutions. This book addresses the impact of important climatic changes on plant pests (including weeds, diseases and insect pests), and their interactions with crop plants. Anthropogenic activities have seriously impacted the global climate. As a result, carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature levels of the earth are on a continuous rise. The global temperature is expected to increase by a 3°C or more by the end of this century. The CO2 concentration was below 300 parts per million (ppm) before the start of the industrial era; however, recently it has exceeded 400 ppm. This is highest ever in human history. Other than global warming and elevated CO2 concentrations, anthropogenic activities have also disturbed the global water cycle, ultimately, impacting the quantity and distribution of rainfall. This has resulted in drought conditions in many parts of the world. Global warming, elevated CO2 concentration and drought are considered the most important recent climatic changes that are impacting global ecosystems and human societies. Among other impacts, the effects of climatic changes on pests, pest-crop interactions and pest control are important with relevance to global food security, and hence require immediate attention by plant scientists.

The development of traffic in Germany in recent decades has been characterised above all by an increase in the distances travelled and an increase in car, truck and air traffic. For at least 30 years, the associated negative consequences have prompted the development of new planning concepts for traffic avoidance, modal shift and more compatible traffic management. Significant successes can be seen only with regard to more compatible traffic management. Selective successes are seen with regard to modal shift but with a simultaneous increase in the distances covered, which is fed by numerous, socially desirable developments.

The topic is addressed both theoretically and conceptually, as well as by means of concrete examples, in order to be able to derive conclusions for policy, planning practice and research.

Computer vision entails both passive and active illumination techniques. Whereas passive techniques observe the scene statically and analyse it as is, by contrast active techniques give the scene some actions and try to facilitate the analysis. In particular, active illumination techniques project specific light, for which the characteristics are known beforehand, to a target scene to enable stable and accurate analysis of the scene. Notably, traditional passive techniques have a fundamental limitation: The external world surrounding us is three-dimensional; the image projected on a retina or an imaging device is two-dimensional (That is, reduction of one dimension has occurred). Active illumination techniques compensate for the dimensional reduction by actively controlling the illumination. The demand for reliable vision sensors is rapidly increasing in many application areas, such as robotics and medical image analysis. This book explains this new endeavour to explore the augmentation of reduced dimensions in computer vision. This pivotal volume comprehensively examines basic optics concepts, available active-lighting techniques, and various application domains. Primarily aimed at advanced undergraduates and beginning graduates, the book also will serve as a useful guidebook for engineers from fields both in and beyond computer vision.

These include electrical grids, pipelines, radar, wireless signaling, navigation, flying spacecraft, and telephony - technologies that cross continents, oceans, and now space. Regardless of specific application, successful operational use of these technologies has determined that compelling needs exist to take into account Sun and Earth space phenomena and processes in both design and implementation. Increasingly sophisticated technical systems require increasingly detailed understanding of solar and terrestrial space phenomena. Achieving this detailed understanding has been aided by the access to space provided by reliable launch vehicles, and by ever more sophisticated instrumentation deployed to measure Earth's space environment. The data acquired can be incorporated into ever better models to describe and even forecast the environment and its changes. This volume contains nine chapters, written by experts, describing current day technologies and how solar and terrestrial space processes can affect them. Without these technologies, contemporary life in civil, commercial, and national security realms would be very different, and arguably impossible. Another chapter in this volume outlines a number of issues related to human survival in the space radiation environment inside and outside Earth's magnetosphere. An Epilogue closes by looking to the future in this broad area of applied geophysics. As the historical record demonstrates, despite specific qualities such as form and function, there is a high likelihood that some electrical technologies yet to be implemented or invented will always require design features whose goals are to ensure successful operations under all levels of solar and terrestrial conditions.

Discover the functioning and example uses of the Common Lisp condition system. This book supplements already existing material for studying Common Lisp as a language by providing detailed information about the Lisp condition system and its control flow mechanisms; it also describes an example ANSI-conformant implementation of the condition system. In part 1 of The Common Lisp Condition System, the author introduces the condition system using a bottom-up approach, constructing it piece by piece. He uses a storytelling approach to convey the foundation of the condition system, dynamically providing code to alter the behavior of an existing program. Later, in part 2, you’ll implement a full and complete ANSI-conformant condition system while examining and testing each piece of code that you write. Throughout, the author demonstrates how to extend Lisp using Lisp itself by using the condition system as an example. This is done while paying proper attention to the CL restart subsystem, giving it attention on a par with the handler subsystem. After reading and using this book, you'll have learned about the inner functioning of the condition system, how to use it in your own Common Lisp coding and applications, and how to implement it from scratch, should such a need arise.

As venture capital and industrial resources are increasingly poured into rapid advances in artificial intelligence, the actual usage and success of AI depends on a satisfactory experience for the user. UX will play a significant role in the adoption of AI technologies across markets, and AI and UX explores just what these demands will entail. Great effort has been put forth to continuously make AI “smarter.” But, will smarter always equal more successful AI? It is not just about getting a product to market, but about getting the product into a user’s hands in a form that will be embraced. This demands examining the product from the perspective of the user. Authors Gavin Lew and Robert Schumacher have written AI and UX to examine just how product managers and designers can best strike this balance. From exploring the history of the parallel journeys of AI and UX, to investigating past product examples and failures, to practical expert knowledge on how to best execute a positive user experience, AI and UX examines all angles of how AI can best be developed within a UX framework. The new world of AI necessitates an equally new UX lens through which to see all potential products. While massive inroads have created strides in AI technology, it must be accessible and easy to use for the consumer. Innovators in the field need to shift thinking from “it works” to “it works well,” which makes all the difference in increasing adoption. Let your users enhance your data, and let the UX of your product do the selling for you. AI and UX is your roadmap for the future. 1. Introduction to AI and UX -- 2.

In Digital Methods, Richard Rogers proposes a methodological outlook for social and cultural scholarly research on the Web that seeks to move Internet research beyond the study of online culture. It is not a toolkit for Internet research, or operating instructions for a software package; it deals with broader questions. How can we study social media to learn something about society rather than about social media use? How can hyperlinks reveal not just the value of a Web site but the politics of association? Rogers proposes repurposing Web-native techniques for research into cultural change and societal conditions. We can learn to reapply such \"methods of the medium\" as crawling and crowd sourcing, PageRank and similar algorithms, tag clouds and other visualizations; we can learn how they handle hits, likes, tags, date stamps, and other Web-native objects. By \"thinking along\" with devices and the objects they handle, digital research methods can follow the evolving methods of the medium. Rogers uses this new methodological outlook to examine the findings of inquiries into 9/11 search results, the recognition of climate change skeptics by climate-change-related Web sites, the events surrounding the Srebrenica massacre according to Dutch, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian Wikipedias, presidential candidates' social media \"friends,\" and the censorship of the Iranian Web.

Featuring a wide-ranging set of contributions from top researchers, this book discusses and analyzes the issues that different cities face, such as social cohesion, tolerance and cultural diversity, and how this will determine their developmental trajectories through the coming decade. These issues are explored in relation to contemporary topics including the growing economy of robotics, the rising importance and use of artificial intelligence and the information and communications economy. Towards a Competitive, Sustainable Modern City will be an invaluable read for scholars and professors in urban economics and urban studies more broadly, particularly those who are focusing on the importance of sustainability in both areas.

The digital age has thrown questions of representation, participation and humanitarianism back to the fore, as machine learning, algorithms and big data centres take over the process of mapping the subjugated and subaltern. Since the rise of Google Earth in 2005, there has been an explosion in the use of mapping tools to quantify and assess the needs of those in crisis, including those affected by climate change and the wider neo-liberal agenda. Yet, while there has been a huge upsurge in the data produced around these issues, the representation of people remains questionable. Some have argued that representation has diminished in humanitarian crises as people are increasingly reduced to data points. In turn, this data has become ever more difficult to analyse without vast computing power, leading to a dependency on the old colonial powers to refine the data collected from people in crisis, before selling it back to them.This book brings together critical perspectives on the role that mapping people, knowledges and data now plays in humanitarian work, both in cartographic terms and through data visualisations, and questions whether, as we map crises, it is the map itself that is in crisis", "title_en": "Mapping crisis : participation, datafication and humanitarianism in the age of digital mapping"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4029823-1", "gnd:4123065-6", "gnd:4011152-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2020", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

In recent years, machine learning, including deep learning, has begun to be used in various physics studies. Why is that? Is knowing physics useful in machine learning? Conversely, is knowing machine learning useful in physics? This book is devoted to answers of these questions. Starting with basic ideas of physics, neural networks are derived naturally. And you can learn the concepts of deep learning through the words of physics. In fact, the foundation of machine learning can be attributed to physical concepts. Hamiltonians that determine physical systems characterize various machine learning structures. Statistical physics given by Hamiltonians defines machine learning by neural networks. Furthermore, solving inverse problems in physics through machine learning and generalization essentially provides progress and even revolutions in physics. For these reasons, in recent years interdisciplinary research in machine learning and physics has been expanding dramatically. This book is written for anyone who wants to learn, understand, and apply the relationship between deep learning/machine learning and physics. All that is needed to read this book are the basic concepts in physics: energy and Hamiltonians. The concepts of statistical mechanics and the bracket notation of quantum mechanics, which are explained in columns, are used to explain deep learning frameworks.

This book examines the role, history and function of public libraries in contemporary societies as motors that drive development. It analyses through case studies, how contemporary libraries have been redesigned to offer a new kind of public space while also reshaping neglected areas in cities. Broadly understood the book seeks to comprehend contemporary library design, urban development and the revitalization of specific urban areas. Important and world famous architects – star-architects – have designed signature architecture in the contemporary libraries selected for this volume. The examples to be showcased in the book include the main Seattle Public Library, Salt Lake City Public Library, New York Public Library, Spain Library Medellin, Colombia, Halifax Central Library Nova Scotia, Canada and Library of Alexandria in Egypt to offer examples of what constitute the approach to libraries and urban development in many cities around the world nowadays. Data in the form of interviews to library directors, librarians and users, tours of libraries, visual documentation and archival research have been collected for most public libraries included as case studies for the book. The impulse to archive has been framed and understood in the literature as a modern desire to control fleeting reality. Libraries as such respond to this desire by collecting, storing and circulating resources (books and other kinds of media). But more recently there has been an emphasis on the public character of library spaces in which people gather not only to obtain information and read by themselves but also to experience the very urban quality of proximity to others in more informal and less structured environments as public space. Community events characterize the programming of all the libraries included in the book. The design of these new libraries fit into urban development initiatives where libraries – like other iconic cultural spaces of cities – become central components to market cities for the consumption of culture. Libraries become sites to be visited and explored by tourists while providing services for residents.

This book discusses theoretical and experimental advances in metamaterial structures, which are of fundamental importance to many applications in microwave and optical-wave physics and materials science. Metamaterial structures exhibit time-reversal and space-inversion symmetry breaking due to the effects of magnetism and chirality. The book addresses the characteristic properties of various symmetry breaking processes by studying field-matter interaction with use of conventional electromagnetic waves and novel types of engineered fields: twisted-photon fields, toroidal fields, and magnetoelectric fields. In a system with a combined effect of simultaneous breaking of space and time inversion symmetries, one observes the magnetochiral effect. Another similar phenomenon featuring space-time inversion symmetries is related to use of magnetoelectric materials. Cross-coupling of the electric and magnetic components in these material structures, leading to the appearance of new magnetic modes with an electric excitation channel – electromagnons and skyrmions – has resulted in a wealth of strong optical effects such as directional dichroism, magnetochiral dichroism, and rotatory power of the fields. This book contains multifaceted contributions from international leading experts and covers the essential aspects of symmetry-breaking effects, including theory, modeling and design, proven and potential applications in practical devices, fabrication, characterization and measurement.

This person was the author Doris Lessing. She would eventually go on to win the Nobel Prize for literature as an 'epicist ... who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny'. And it was precisely this scrutiny that troubled the guardians of the status quo. Lessing grew up in colonial Rhodesia and hated the scorn with which the colonists treated the native population. She worked tirelessly for a more just society and this drove her into support for communism. But a communist, as one of her fictional characters says, 'is hated, despised, feared and hunted'. Peter Raina's book, reproducing the secret files kept on Lessing, shows that this was largely true, even though her emphasis in these troubled times was always on Peace. Lessing was eventually disillusioned by communism, and sought a better understanding of human relations than Soviet-conforming clichés could provide. However, her understanding was much enriched by the experiences of her activism and knowledge of the opposition it aroused. The secret files show how strongly Lessing followed her convictions and throw new light on how her perceptions of society evolved.

This open access book summarizes the results of the collaborative project “GeomInt: Geomechanical integrity of host and barrier rocks - experiment, modeling and analysis of discontinuities” within the Program: Geo Research for Sustainability (GEO: N) of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The use of geosystems as a source of resources, a storage space, for installing underground municipal or traffic infrastructure has become much more intensive and diverse in recent years. Increasing utilization of the geological environment requires careful analyses of the rock–fluid systems as well as assessments of the feasibility, efficiency and environmental impacts of the technologies under consideration.

This book considers dynamic boundary value problems in domains with singularities of two types.

Singularities of the second type are \"singularly perturbed edges\" such as smoothed corners and edges and small holes. A domain with singularities of such type depends on a small parameter, whereas the boundary of the limit domain (as the parameter tends to zero) has usual edges, i.e. singularities of the first type. In the transition from the limit domain to the perturbed one, the boundary near a conical point or an edge becomes smooth, isolated singular points become small cavities, and so on. In an \"irregular\" domain with such singularities, problems of elastodynamics, electrodynamics and some other dynamic problems are discussed.

These three methods combined form an immensely useful toolkit for investigations in such disparate areas of physics as excitation in molecular crystals, sensitized luminescence, charge transport, non-equilibrium statistical physics, vibrational relaxation, granular materials, NMR, and even theoretical ecology.

Far from it: as this study convincingly shows, norms matter online. In a tour de force, internet law expert Matthias C. Kettemann analyses the genesis, ontology, and legitimation of rule and rules on the internet. Innovatively, the study establishes the emergence of a normative order of the internet, an order that integrates norms materially and normatively connected to the use and development of the internet at three different levels (regional, national, international), of two types (privately and publicly authored), and of different character (from ius cogens to technical standards). Centrifugal forces contribute to normative redundancies (“normative froth”), real conflicts of norms between regulatory layers and geographically bounded normative spheres (“normative friction”), substantial structural problems (“normative fractures”), and political, commercial, and technological fragmentation of the internet. But these forces of normative disorder can be countered. As the study impressively shows, a normative turn has taken place on the internet. The rules on rule-making that have developed within the normative order of the internet explain, predict, and legitimize the creation of new norms through processes of self-learning normativity. These norms are then assessed for their internal coherence, consonance with other order norms, and consistency with the order’s finality. The normative order of the internet is based on and produces a liquefied system characterized by self-learning normativity. Thus a theory of normativity (“of the law”) that goes back to Kant needs to be fundamentally rethought: with norm-based self-organization as the principle of life that enables the transcendental constitution of normativityon the internet.", "title_en": "The normative order of the internet : a theory of rule and regulation online"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4308416-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1013322371", "year": "2020", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The preparation tasks include the removal of components, the incorporation of additives, and the change of particle size. Compounding is the incorporation of additives into a polymer or plastic. The process engineering fundamentals and the specific equipment and machines used are described. The specialist authors impart their knowledge from the fields of research, polymer production, and equipment/machine production with applications in plastics technology. Dr. Klemens Kohlgrüber undertook a metalworking apprenticeship and completed further training as a mechanical engineer in Cologne. He studied mechanical engineering in Wuppertal, followed by a diploma and doctorate at RWTH Aachen University. From 1986 to 2015, he worked for Bayer AG, among other things as Head of High Viscosity, Mixing, and Reactor Technology. At the same time, he gave lectures for several years at the University of Dortmund for chemists in the master’s program on polymer processing/preparation. For several years he was head of the High Viscosity Technology working group of the Forschungsgesellschaft Verfahrenstechnik (German Research Association for Process Engineering) and he is a former member of the Association of German Engineers (VDI) advisory board for plastics processing technology. Dr. Kohlgrüber also leads annual VDI seminars on extruders. Dr.-Ing. Michael Bierdel studied process engineering at the University of Stuttgart and received his doctorate in 2001. Since 2001 he has been working in research and development at Bayer Technology Services GmbH (Bayer AG), now Covestro Deutschland AG (Covestro AG), in the High Viscosity Technology group, which he has led since 2012. Dipl.-Ing. Harald Rust studied mechanical engineering in Bochum and successfully completed his studies in 1975. After various positions as a development engineer, he founded his own engineering office in 1985. From 1987 the further development of the company Entex to a machine factory took place.

The concepts of purity and contamination preoccupied early modern Europeans fundamentally, structuring virtually every aspect of their lives, not least how they created and experienced works of art and the built environment. In an era that saw a great number of objects and people in motion, the meteoric rise of new artistic and building technologies, and religious upheaval exert new pressures on art and its institutions, anxieties about the pure and the contaminated - distinctions between the clean and unclean, sameness and difference, self and other, organization and its absence - took on heightened importance. In this series of geographically and methodologically wide-ranging essays, thirteen leading historians of art and architecture grapple with the complex ways that early modern actors negotiated these concerns, covering topics as diverse as Michelangelo's unfinished sculptures, Venetian plague hospitals, Spanish-Muslim tapestries, and emergency currency. The resulting volume offers surprising new insights into the period and into the modern disciplinary routines of art and architectural history", "title_en": "Contamination and purity in early modern art and architecture"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4002851-3", "gnd:4136148-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2021", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

From the geological and mineralogical point of view rocks may be distinguished by their macroscopic properties studied in field and by the microscopic properties studied by mineralogists and petrologists in labs. Rocks also possess some very variable physical properties such as density, elastic modulus, permeability, porosity, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, etc. just as any other solid material. From the geophysical point of view rocks are an environmental medium which properties are needed to be known in order to provide an adequate interpretation of geophysical measurements.

It is well known that we are living in a time of demographic shift to an ageing society, yet our responses to this are still uneven and often spring from dated assumptions and images of older people. The significance of place in all our lives, but particularly in the lives of older people, puts responsibility on planners and other place-makers to challenge ideas about later life by developing practices of involvement that put older people's voices at the core of planning responses. This book introduces planners to dominant ideas about ageing and how these have influenced the responses of place-makers, considering how the demographic shift may be a catalyst for new thinking in place-making. It is not so much about planning for old people, but about how an ageing population changes all aspects of our lives.0The book introduces useful concepts such as the 20-minute neighbourhood and the everyday-life framework; explains the age-friendly movement; and questions to what extent it helps cities respond to change. Comparing international case studies, it explores the critical role of housing and the possible use of land allocation to encourage developers to think about better and more housing options for later life.

In the first part of the book, starting with the systematic description of the instanton, how to integrate out the instanton moduli space is explained together with the equivariant localization formula. It is then illustrated that this formalism is generalized to various situations, including quiver and fractional quiver gauge theory, supergroup gauge theory. The second part of the book is devoted to the algebraic geometric description of supersymmetric gauge theory, known as the Seiberg–Witten theory, together with string/M-theory point of view.

The first part, Technologies and Connections, historicises concepts like network, media convergence, multimedia, interactivity and artificial intelligence. The second one is related to Agency and Politics and explores global governance, datafication, fake news, echo chambers, digital media activism. The last one, Users and Practices, is finally devoted to telepresence, digital loneliness, amateurism, user generated content, fandom and authenticity. The book aims to shed light on how concepts emerge and are co-shaped, circulated, used and reappropriated in different contexts. It argues for the need for a conceptual media and communication history that will reveal new developments without concealing continuities and it demonstrates how the analogue/digital dichotomy is often a misleading one.", "title_en": "Digital roots : historicizing media and communication concepts of the digital age"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4113450-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1065492103", "year": "2021", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The universe of actors involved in international cybersecurity includes both state actors and semi- and non-state actors, including technology companies, state-sponsored hackers, and cybercriminals. Among these are semi-state actors - actors in a close relationship with one state who sometimes advance this state's interests, but are not organizationally integrated into state functions. In Semi-State Actors in Cybersecurity, Florian J. Egloff argues that political relations in cyberspace fundamentally involve concurrent collaboration and competition between states and semi-state actors. To understand the complex interplay of cooperation and competition and the power relations that exist between these actors in international relations, Egloff looks to a historical analogy: that of mercantile companies, privateers, and pirates. Pirates, privateers, and mercantile companies were integral to maritime security between the 16th and 19th centuries. In fact, privateers and mercantile companies, like today's tech companies and private cyber contractors, had a particular relationship to the state in that they conducted state-sanctioned private attacks against foreign vessels. Pirates, like independent hackers, were sometimes useful allies, and other times enemies. These actors traded, explored, plundered, and controlled sea-lanes and territories across the world's oceans - with state navies lagging behind, often burdened by hierarchy. Today, as cyberspace is woven into the fabric of all aspects of society, the provision and undermining of security in digital spaces has become a new arena for digital pirates, privateers, and mercantile companies. In making the analogy to piracy and privateering, Egloff provides a new understanding of how attackers and defenders use their proximity to the state politically and offers lessons for understanding how actors exercise power in cyberspace. Drawing on historical archival sources, Egloff identifies the parallels between today's cyber in-security and the historical quest for gold and glory on the high seas. The book explains what the presence of semi-state actors means for national and international security, and how semi-state actors are historically and contemporarily linked to understandings of statehood, sovereignty, and the legitimacy of the state.", "title_en": "Semi-state actors in cybersecurity"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4038301-5", "gnd:4010452-7", "gnd:4128014-3", "gnd:4274324-2", "gnd:4266146-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1226122396", "year": "2022", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This book presents an in-depth study to show that a sustainable future urban life is possible. To build a safer and more sustainable future, as humankind, we would like to use more renewable energy, increase energy efficiency, reduce our carbon and water footprints in all economic sectors. The increasing population and humans’ ever-increasing demand for consumption pose another question whether the world’s resources are sufficient for present and future generations. Fair access to water, energy, and food is the objective for all. In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, scientists, researchers, engineers, and policymakers worldwide are working hard to achieve these objectives. To answer all these challenges, we would like to introduce the core of Smart Cities of the future, the building block of the future’s urban life: Open Digital Innovation Hub (ODIH). ODIH will serve as the ‘Home of the Future’, a fully digitalised and smart, self-sustaining building that answers all the motivation we highlight here. In ODIH, we introduce a living space that produces its water, energy, and food by minimising carbon and water footprints thanks to the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain technologies. It will also serve as an open innovation environment for start-ups and entrepreneurs who wish to integrate their solutions into the infrastructure of ODIH and test those in real-time.

Evidence that Einstein's addition is regulated by the Thomas precession has come to light, turning the notorious Thomas precession, previously considered the ugly duckling of special relativity theory, into the beautiful swan of gyrogroup and gyrovector space theory, where it has been extended by abstraction into an automorphism generator, called the Thomas gyration. The Thomas gyration, in turn, allows the introduction of vectors into hyperbolic geometry, where they are called gyrovectors, in such a way that Einstein's velocity additions turns out to be a gyrovector addition. Einstein's addition thus becomes a gyrocommutative, gyroassociative gyrogroup operation in the same way that ordinary vector addition is a commutative, associative group operation. Some gyrogroups of gyrovectors admit scalar multiplication, giving rise to gyrovector spaces in the same way that some groups of vectors that admit scalar multiplication give rise to vector spaces. Furthermore, gyrovector spaces form the setting for hyperbolic geometry in the same way that vector spaces form the setting for Euclidean geometry. In particular, the gyrovector space with gyrovector addition given by Einstein's (Möbius') addition forms the setting for the Beltrami (Poincaré) ball model of hyperbolic geometry. The gyrogroup-theoretic techniques developed in this book for use in relativity physics and in hyperbolic geometry allow one to solve old and new important problems in relativity physics. A case in point is Einstein's 1905 view of the Lorentz length contraction, which was contradicted in 1959 by Penrose, Terrell and others. The application of gyrogroup-theoretic techniques clearly tilt the balance in favor of Einstein.", "title_en": "Beyond the Einstein Addition Law and its Gyroscopic Thomas Precession : The Theory of Gyrogroups and Gyrovector Spaces"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4182215-8", "gnd:4161041-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Ungar, A.A.", "year": "2002", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The emphasis now placed on the concept of sediment cells as boundaries for coastal defence groups, and the development of SMPs, should help CPAs realise the importance of natural processes at the coast when designing defence and protection schemes. However, this will only be the case where defence groups exist, and where CPAs take up the challenge of developing SMPs. Coastal landscapes have been produced by the natural forces of wind, waves and tides, and many are nationally or internationally important for their habitats and natural features. Past practices at the coast, such as the construction of harbours, jetties and traditional defence systems may have contributed to the deterioration of the coast.

As quantum theory enters its second century, it is fitting to examine just how far it has come as a tool for the chemist. Beginning with Max Planck’s agonizing conclusion in 1900 that linked energy emission in discreet bundles to the resultant black-body radiation curve, a body of knowledge has developed with profound consequences in our ability to understand nature. In the early years, quantum theory was the providence of physicists and certain breeds of physical chemists. While physicists honed and refined the theory and studied atoms and their component systems, physical chemists began the foray into the study of larger, molecular systems. Quantum theory predictions of these systems were first verified through experimental spectroscopic studies in the electromagnetic spectrum (microwave, infrared and ultraviolet/visible), and, later, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Over two generations these studies were hampered by two major drawbacks: lack of resolution of spectroscopic data, and the complexity of calculations. This powerful theory that promised understanding of the fundamental nature of molecules faced formidable challenges. The following example may put things in perspective for today’s chemistry faculty, college seniors or graduate students: As little as 40 years ago, force field calculations on a molecule as simple as ketene was a four to five year dissertation project.", "title_en": "Fundamentals of Quantum Chemistry : Molecular Spectroscopy and Modern Electronic Structure Computations"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4128850-6", "gnd:4047979-1", "gnd:4178503-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Mueller, Michael P.", "year": "2001", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The first two essays provide the necessary background; the remaining seven essays lead logically from these to the treatment of a series of applications, including inviscid and viscous fluids, the effects of rotation and the stability of freezing and melting fronts. The discussion is, for the most part, limited to problems that can be solved analytically, and thus to linear problems. The techniques used to analyze the problems can, however, be generalized to nonlinear problems and numerical methods. Intended for graduate students and researchers in fluid mechanics, the treatment assumes some knowledge of fluid mechanics. Students whose research problems involve multi-phase flows will find the concepts in this manuscript to be helpful in describing boundary conditions for their formulations.

However, in recent years, disposal of plastic food packaging wastes, particularly the single use plastics, have become major concerns as environmental pollutants. In this context, biopolymer based neat, composite or hybrid films and coatings have gained tremendous research interests to address these concerns. Biopolymers are characterized by easy disposal, recycling, rapid biodegradation or composting, which make them environment-friendly. Plant based biopolymers such as starch, cellulose, pectin, gluten, zein, carnauba wax; animal based biopolymers such as gelatin, casein, chitosan, beeswax; microbial biopolymers such as dextran, pullulan, xanthan, microbial cellulose; and biopolymers derived from biobased monomers such as polylactic acid (PLA) are commonly used to fabricate films and coatings for food packaging applications. Biopolymer based films and coatings suffer from relatively inferior mechanical and barrier properties compared to synthetic plastics, and also lack the desired antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. To address these shortcoming, composite or hybrid films blended with other biopolymer(s) and/or reinforced with filler materials e.g. essential oil components, nanoparticles, antimicrobials and antioxidants, etc. are effective. Despite all these advantages, the manufacturing cost of biopolymer based food packaging films and coatings is higher than that of synthetic plastic films and coatings.

To claim that Tenses are real is to claim that they are satisfied, i.e. that something in fact possesses them.

Realists about Tense (so-called A-theorists)claim that things really do have Tenses, antirealists (Btheorists) deny this. Most of them claim that Tenses can be reduced to tenseless properties. This book criticises the current debate between A-theorists like Quentin Smith and B-theorists like D. H. Mellor on methodological grounds. It suggests an alternative strategy for how the debate might proceed, where insights from other kinds of realism-debates are made useful for the debate about Tense.

In Projecting Spirits, Pasi Väliaho maps how the leading optical media of the period--the camera obscura and the magic lantern--developed in response to, and framed, the era's key intellectual dilemma of whether the world fell under God's providential care, or was subject to chance and open to speculating. As Väliaho shows, camera obscuras and magic lanterns were variously employed to give the world an intelligible and manageable design. Jesuit scholars embraced devices of projection as part of their pursuit of divine government, whilst the Royal Society fellows enlisted them in their quest for empirical knowledge as well as colonial expansion. Projections of light and shadow grew into critical metaphors in early responses to the turbulences of finance. In such instances, Väliaho argues, \"projection\" became an indispensable cognitive form to both assert providence, and to make sense of an economic reality that was gradually escaping from divine guidance.

This book presents how metasurfaces are exploited to develop new low-cost single sensor based multispectral cameras. Multispectral cameras extend the concept of conventional colour cameras to capture images with multiple color bands and with narrow spectral passbands. Images from a multispectral camera can extract significant amount of additional information that the human eye or a normal camera fails to capture and thus have important applications in precision agriculture, forestry, medicine, object identifications, and classifications. Conventional multispectral cameras are made up of multiple image sensors each externally fitted with a narrow passband wavelength filters, optics and multiple electronics. The need for multiple sensors for each band results in a number of problems such as being bulky, power hungry and suffering from image co-registration problems which in turn limits their wide usage.

This book sets out the discussion on how cities can contribute solutions to some of the challenges the urbanised world is facing, such as the pressure of growing populations, mitigation of effects of, and adaptation to globally changing environmental, climate and public health conditions. Presenting a detailed explanation of the causes behind the current state of modern cities, the book advocates for a paradigm shift to improve the quality of life of ever-increasing urban inhabitants whilst nourishing the natural systems that sustain human and non-human life in the planet. Recognising the precious role that nature plays in the functioning of cities, it delves into the study of biophilic design and regenerative development. The book argues that these social-ecological design approaches can act as catalysts to develop conditions in urban settings that are beneficial for natural and human systems to thrive and flourish, both in ecosystem services and social-cultural systems. This is particularly relevant for the design of new quality precincts or the regeneration of degraded urban spaces to promote health, wellbeing and urban resilience. A framework is proposed to guide the process of thinking about, designing and building healthier, more liveable and resilient urban environments that raise the quality of life in cities. The method can be used by researchers, practitioners -urban designers, urban planners, architects and landscape architects- interested in developing their work within a social-ecological perspective. It can also be used by local governments and agencies to underpin policy making, and by educational institutions to prepare graduates with necessary skills to respond to current and future built environment challenges.", "title_en": "Regenerating cities : reviving places and planet"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4077809-5", "gnd:4056730-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1211528561", "year": "2022", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This textbook is intended for both undergraduate and graduate courses in meteorology and atmospheric sciences, as well as for researchers working on theoretical and numerical aspects of weather and climate or on geophysical fluid dynamics. The treatment is concise, thorough, and self-contained. All necessary concepts are introduced, and the reader is given explicit guidance on all mathematical steps. The book begins with a derivation of the equations of motion. These are then used to discuss fundamental aspects of weather and climate. The mechanisms behind vortical motions, that are known from the daily weather map, are discussed. Shallow-water theory is introduced as a tool for an efficient analysis of key concepts, such as atmospheric waves and synoptic-scale vortices. Quasigeostrophic theory is described and then used to explain the occurrence and mechanisms of extratropical weather by means of baroclinic instability. The specific properties of the atmospheric boundary layer are discussed, with a focus on the interaction between turbulence and mean flows. This is followed by a detailed look at the global atmospheric circulation, highlighting its control by Rossby waves and gravity waves. At the same time, the reader is introduced to essential concepts that find applications in the field, such as balance by geostrophic and hydrostatic equilibrium, the role of entropy and potential temperature, potential vorticity, the Kelvin theorem, instability theory, the Reynolds equations, Eliassen-Palm and pseudo-momentum flux, multi-scale asymptotics, WKB theory, wave action, the transformed Eulerian mean, critical layers, and wave refraction. The text is supplemented by appendices on important mathematical concepts and further elaborations of the main text. Chapter summaries and reading recommendations help the reader not merely to keep focus on the essentials, but just as well to broaden the horizon. The Author Ulrich Achatz holds the chair for the Theory of Atmospheric Dynamics and Climate at Goethe Universität Frankfurt. He has a diploma in physics and a PhD in astronomy, both from the University of Bonn, and a habilitation degree in atmospheric physics from the University of Rostock.

This book highlights the importance of Electron Statistics (ES), which occupies a singular position in the arena of solid state sciences, in heavily doped (HD) nanostructures by applying Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle directly without using the complicated Density-of-States function approach as given in the literature. The materials considered are HD quantum confined nonlinear optical, III-V, II-VI, IV-VI, GaP, Ge, PtSb2, stressed materials, GaSb, Te, II-V, Bi2Te3, lead germanium telluride, zinc and cadmium diphosphides, and quantum confined III-V, IV-VI, II-VI and HgTe/CdTe super-lattices with graded interfaces and effective mass super-lattices. The presence of intense light waves in optoelectronics and strong electric field in nano-devices change the band structure of materials in fundamental ways, which have also been incorporated in the study of ES in HD quantized structures of optoelectronic compounds that control the studies of the HD quantum effect devices under strong fields. The influence of magnetic quantization, magneto size quantization, quantum wells, wires and dots, crossed electric and quantizing fields, intense electric field, and light waves on the ES in HD quantized structures and superlattices are discussed. The content of this book finds six different applications in the arena of nano-science and nanotechnology and the various ES dependent electronic quantities, namely the effective mass, the screening length, the Einstein relation and the elastic constants have been investigated.

As most work till date have shown to implement algorithms that require windowing of the accumulated data, the monograph seamlessly presents a coherent transition from the traditional batch mode practise towards a recently developed array of recursive approaches. Under this framework, the book mainly focuses on the theoretical development and engineering applications of algorithms that are premised on first order perturbation (FOP) techniques. The development of real time algorithms aimed at identifying the structural systems and the inflicted damage, online, through theoretical approaches paves way for an in-depth understanding of the discussed topics. It then continues to demonstrate the solution to a class of inverse dynamic problems through numerically simulated systems. Extensive theoretical derivations supported by mathematical formulations, pivoted around the simple concepts of eigenspace updates, forms the key cornerstone of the book. The output response streaming in real time from multi degree of freedom systems provide key information about the system's health that is subsequently utilized to identify the modal parameters and the damage, in real time. Damage indicators connotative of the nature, instant and location of damage, identified in a single framework are developed in the light of real time damage case studies. Backed by a comprehensive assortment of experimental test-beds, this book includes demonstrations to emulate real life damage scenarios under controlled laboratory conditions. Applicability of the proposed recursive methods towards practical problems demonstrate their robustness as viable candidates for real time structural health monitoring\"--", "title_en": "Real-time structural health monitoring of vibrating systems"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:1088793878", "gnd:4355658-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Pakrashi, Vikram; Bhowmik, Basuraj; Hazra, Budhaditya", "year": "2022", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The book is based on a lifetime’s accumulated knowledge by acclaimed speaker designer William H. (Bill) Watkins. It differs from the usual tone of most technical books on this subject by initially presenting, and analyzing in full, the function of each key parameter of a reference dynamic loudspeaker. Each parameter’s value is then calculated and also confirmed via lab measurements to vividly illustrate all energy-transduction facets of loudspeaker operation and the forced vibration. This presentation style makes the analysis both more engaging, intuitive, and easier to comprehend compared to most previous works in the field. The principles of this book apply to all direct reciprocating motors, not just those in a dynamic loudspeaker. Unique to the book is an entire chapter dedicated to the discussion of back-EMF voltage, discussed from several technical points of view and analyzed in depth as related to the dynamic transfer of energy between the mechanical and electrical domains.

The book therefore describes, among other things, innovative water- and liquid-metal-cooled reactors, high-temperature and molten-salt reactors, and discusses their significance for the economy and society. The author imparts relevant basic knowledge of nuclear technology and then uses some illustrative examples to show what future opportunities this fourth generation of nuclear reactors will offer, but also what challenges will be associated with it. About the author Prof. Dr. -Ing. Thomas Schulenberg studied physics and mechanical engineering and received his doctorate in the field of sodium-cooled reactors. During his fourteen-year industrial career, he developed gas turbines for conventional power plants. Since 2000, Prof. Schulenberg was the head of the Institute for Nuclear and Energy Technology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where he lectured on conventional power plant technology as well as nuclear power plant technology. As a member of the steering committee for fourth-generation water-cooled reactors, he was actively involved in the Generation IV International Forum for many years. This book is a translation of an original German edition. The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence (machine translation by the service DeepL.com). A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content, so that the book will read stylistically differently from a conventional translation.", "title_en": "The fourth generation of nuclear reactors : fundamentals, types, and benefits explained"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4429725-7", "gnd:4030344-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1023820161", "year": "2022", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Many companies rank the most liveable city in the world or in a nation and many indicators try to measure factors which can report the health of a place by investigating it in different ways. If, from a part, the liveability and health concepts are more and more explored in urban studies, on the other, due to the strong contamination coming from other disciplines, it is possible to understand why a place is liveable, but it is difficult to design a place being sure that this will be healthy and liveable. Accordingly, aim of this book is, after the definition of the field of investigation concerning sustainable regeneration trough topics such as resilience, adaptation, health and mixed connections, to illustrate the present-day approaches to the analysis and design of healthy places, and in particular the original Healthy Pl@ce Design method, flexible and repeatable in different contexts. The method aims at: identifying sustainable urban liveability and healthy and the factors which make places liveable and healthy from the user's point of view and identifying design interventions to enhance or create both urban liveability and health. Emblematic case studies carried out in Europe, USA and China - Bordeaux, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Madrid, Newcastle, Nice, Dublin, Vancouver and Wuhan - constitute the empirical part of the Book detailed with surveys, questionnaires, images and maps.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1807342980", "content": {"text": "Niels Bohr : on the constitution of atoms and molecules. Niels Bohr’s atomic theory of 1913 is one of the absolute highlights in the history of modern science. It was only with this work that physicists realized that quantum theory is an essential ingredient in atomic physics, and it was also only with this work that Rutherford’s nuclear model dating from 1911 was transformed into a proper theory of atomic structure. In a longer perspective, Bohr’s quantum atom of 1913 gave rise to the later Heisenberg-Schrödinger quantum mechanics and all its marvellous consequences. This book is a detailed account of the origin of the Bohr atom centred around his original scientific articles of 1913 which are here reproduced and provided with the necessary historical background. In addition to the so-called trilogy – the three papers published in Philosophical Magazine – also two other and less well-known yet important papers are included. The present work starts with a condensed biographical account of Bohr’s life and scientific career, from his birth in Copenhagen in 1885 to his death in the same city 77 years later. It then proceeds with a chapter outlining earlier ideas of atomic structure and tracing Bohr’s route from his doctoral dissertation in 1911 over his stays in Cambridge and Manchester to the submission in April 1913 of the first part of the trilogy. The reproduction of Bohr’s five articles is followed by notes and comments directly related to the texts, with the aim of clarifying some of the textual passages and to explicate names and subjects that may not be clear or well known. The reception of Bohr’s radically new theory by contemporary physicists and chemists is discussed in a final chapter, which deals with the immediate reactions to Bohr's theory 1913-1915 mostly among British, German and American scientists. Historians of science have long been occupied with Bohr’s atomic theory, which was the subject of careful studies in connection with its centenary in 2013. The present work offers an extensive source-based account of the original theory aimed at a non-specialist audience with an interest in the history of physics and the origin of the quantum world. In 1922 Bohr was awarded the Nobel Prize for his theory. The coming centenary will undoubtedly cause an increased interest in how he arrived at his revolutionary picture of the constitution of atoms and molecules.", "title_en": "Niels Bohr : on the constitution of atoms and molecules"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4068920-7", "gnd:4003422-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2022", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

These tests provide detailed compositional characteristics which identify subtle changes in conditions and vertical variations in the soil, and which help to explain unusual behavior.

This open access book offers a self-contained introduction to the homotopy theory of simplicial and dendroidal sets and spaces. These are essential for the study of categories, operads, and algebraic structure up to coherent homotopy. The dendroidal theory combines the combinatorics of trees with the theory of Quillen model categories. Dendroidal sets are a natural generalization of simplicial sets from the point of view of operads. In this book, the simplicial approach to higher category theory is generalized to a dendroidal approach to higher operad theory. This dendroidal theory of higher operads is carefully developed in this book. The book also provides an original account of the more established simplicial approach to infinity-categories, which is developed in parallel to the dendroidal theory to emphasize the similarities and differences.

Architecture as a discipline, a profession and an applied practice, is always subordinate to its own conceptual framework, which is one of orderliness. It refers to buildings, but also to infrastructures of thought and knowledge, to conventions and taxonomies, to structures of governance, hierarchies of power and systems of administration. How, then, can one look at queering architectural discourse when the very term 'queer', celebrated for its elusive, slippery nature, resists and attacks such order? Divided into four subsections, the essays in this anthology each purse a distinct line of inquiry - methods, practices, spaces, and pedagogies - in order to help particularize the proposed queering of architecture. They demonstrate the paradoxical nature of the endeavour from a diverse range of perspectives - from the questions of mapping queer theory in architecture; to the issues of queer architectural archives, or lack thereof; to the non-Western linguistic challenges to the very term queer alongside decolonial approaches to architecture via indigeneity and landscape. Queering Architecture not only provides a bold challenge to the normative methods employed in architectural discourse but addresses the paradoxical nature of establishing 'queer' methodologies in itself.

Bioactive compounds in food, known for their positive health effects, can be lost during handling after harvest, processing and storage. While most foods are exposed to processing to increase shelf life and edibility and to ensure microbial safety, conventional processing methods may have disadvantages, such as decreasing the nutritional quality of foods, long processing times, high temperature and high energy uses. For these reasons, novel non-thermal food processing technologies (including HPP, ultrasound) and novel thermal food processing technologies (including microwave/Ohmic heating) have become widespread. This book provides a critical evaluation of the effects of conventional, novel non-thermal, and thermal food processing techniques on the retention and bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds in food materials. Within these three categories, many different processing methods are included: fermentation/germination, drying, extrusion, and modified atmosphere packaging, as well as novel technologies, such as microwave heating, ultrasound, high pressure processing, ozonation, and membrane separation processes. .", "title_en": "Retention of bioactives in food processing"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4145589-7", "gnd:4034901-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2022", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This book explores recent advances in the microbial production of xylitol and its applications in food and medical sector. Xylitol is an important biomolecule from lignocellulose biorefinery which is produced from the xylose by chemical reactions or microbial fermentation methods. Currently, the demand of xylitol at commercial scale is being met through chemical methods. However, recent breakthroughs made in plant cell wall destruction, genetic engineering to develop the designer microorganisms, fermentation methods and media formulations and downstream processing have led the ways for sustainable production of xylitol at commercial scale in lignocellulose biorefineries. Microbial production of xylitol is preferred over the chemical processes as it is environmentally friendly, higher process efficiency with the desired product yield, and product recovery with minimum impurities.

Human decisions, especially in management and personnel selection, are based on making judgments about people analytically and intuitively. Yet in business and scientific contexts, judgments are expected to be based on a rational analysis rather than intuitions or emotions. Intuition is often seen as something mystical that should not be trusted and thus eliminated from human decision-making. Our empirical and theoretical research shows that this is impossible when people are dealing with people. Instead, intuitions and emotions have significant power in the decision-making process. Neuroscience even shows that humans are incapable of switching off their emotions or intuitions when making decisions. Therefore, intuition and emotions as evolutionary achievements of human beings should be looked at more closely to use the wisdom they offer. This book provides an insight into the current state of research on rational-analytical procedures in personnel selection and complements this with research on intuitions and emotions in personnel diagnostics. By integrating scientifically verifiable rational-analytical decision-making procedures with the inner experiential knowledge of people, this book bridges two complementary ways of recognizing and making good decisions. It demonstrates how intuitions are developed and used in different fields of practice and cultures and how scientific research results from rational-analytical and intuitive-emotional selection procedures are successfully integrated by practitioners", "title_en": "Analytics and intuition in the process of selecting talent : a holistic approach"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4033447-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1051421640", "year": "2023", "type": "Book", "language_original": "de"}}

Introduction -- Preliminary: 1 + 1-dimensional dS (dS2) Geometry and Relativity -- 1+3-dimensional dS (dS4) Geometry and Relativity (Classical and Quantum Mechanics) -- 1+3-dimensional dS (dS4) Geometry and Relativity (QFT) -- Notion of Mass in (A)dS4 Relativity. This book reviews the construction of elementary systems living in de Sitter (dS) spacetime, in both the classical and quantum senses. Field theories on dS spacetime are among the most studied mathematical models of the Universe, whether for its earlier period (inflationary phase) or for its current phase of expansion acceleration (dark energy or cosmological constant). Classical elementary systems are Hamiltonian phase spaces, which are associated with co-adjoint orbits of the relativity group. On the other hand, quantum elementary systems are associated with (projective) unitary irreducible representations of the (possibly extended) relativity group (or one of its covering). This study emphasizes the conceptual issues arising in the formulation of such systems and discusses known results in a mathematically rigorous way. Particular attention is paid to: “smooth” transition from classical to quantum theory; physical content under vanishing curvature, from the point of view of a local (“tangent”) Minkowskian observer; and thermal interpretation (on the quantum level), in the sense of the Gibbons-Hawking temperature. Such a mathematical construction is of paramount importance to the understanding of the early Universe (due to the critical role that the dS metric plays in the inflationary cosmological scenarii) as well as to the construction of possible models for late-time cosmology (since a small positive cosmological constant or dark energy seems to be required by recent data). In this sense, this book uniquely blends mathematical physics (spacetime symmetry on classical and quantum levels) and theoretical physics (quantization, quantum field theory, and cosmology). Moreover, the level of exposition varies in different parts of the book so that both experts and beginners alike can utilize the book. In addition, this book: Presents consistent formulations of dS elementary systems on three levels; classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and the quantum field theory Blends mathematical physics (spacetime symmetry on classical and quantum levels) and theoretical physics (quantization, quantum field theory, and cosmology) to uniquely introduce the mathematical structure of dS relativity Discusses conceptual considerations/worries that arise in the formulation of elementary systems.", "title_en": "The de Sitter (dS) group and its representations : an introduction to elementary systems and modeling the dark energy universe"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:7589166-9", "gnd:4162430-0", "gnd:4296767-3", "gnd:4209199-8", "gnd:4359420-7", "gnd:4177686-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Pejhan, Hamed; Enayati, Mohammad; Wang, Anzhong", "year": "2023", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Being self-sustaining and self-organizing with the unique nature of pressure gaining, gaseous detonation and its gas dynamics has been an interdisciplinary frontier for decades. The research of detonation enjoyed its early success from the development of the CJ theory and ZND modeling, but phenomenon is far from being understood quantitatively, and the development of theories to predict the three-dimensional cellular structure remains a formidable task, being essentially a problem in high-speed compressible reacting flow. This theory proposed by the authors’ research group breaks down the limitation of the one-dimensional steady flow hypothesis of the early theories, successfully correlating the propagation and initiation processes of gaseous detonation, and realizing the unified expression of the three-dimensional structure of cell detonation.

The Six Pillars of Calculus: Business Edition is a conceptual and practical introduction to differential and integral calculus for use in a one- or two-semester course. By boiling calculus down to six common-sense ideas, the text invites students to make calculus an integral part of how they view the world. Each pillar is introduced by tackling and solving a challenging, realistic problem. This engaging process of discovery encourages students to wrestle with the material and understand the reasoning behind the techniques they are learning--to focus on when and why to use the tools of calculus, not just on how to apply formulas.Modeling and differential equations are front and center. Solutions begin with numerical approximations; derivatives and integrals emerge naturally as refinements of those approximations. Students use and modify computer programs to reinforce their understanding of each algorithm.The Business Edition of the Six Pillars series has been extensively field-tested at the University of Texas. It features hundreds of examples and problems designed specifically for business students. The core ideas are introduced by modeling market penetration of a new product, tracking changes in the national debt, and maximizing the profit of a business. Along the way, students learn about present value, consumer and producer surplus, amortization, and probability. Intro -- Contents -- Instructors' Guide and Background -- Chapter 1. What is Calculus?

This occurs when the details become so numerous that computer power alone cannot make progress. For neural networks (aka deep learning), this is known as the NP-completeness problem whereby the amount of computation needed to compute network weights grows in a non-polynomial (i.e. exponential) way as the number of weights increases. For systems biology, it happens when there are too many cell-model parameters to allow for successful estimation. For many engineering fields, it happens when the designs become so complex that integrated testing cannot eliminate faults. Nature solved this complex-design problem using evolution. But exactly how it solved it has been a mystery. Both laboratory experiments and computer-simulation attempts eventually stopped evolving. Something more than Darwin's ideas of heredity, variation, and selection was needed. The solution is that there is a fourth element to evolution and that is ecological change. What happens is that a new variation that is selected can change the ecology and the new ecology can create new opportunities for even more new variations to be selected. By this endless cycle, complexity can grow automatically. This book uses the physics of resource flow to describe in detail how that happens and that knowledge can be used to help overcome the problem of complex design. This book is a monograph that can be used as a textbook on how physics plays a strong role in evolution. The key starting ideas are the flow of energy-and-matter resources, organisms making copies of themselves, and ecological change. From these ideas, quantitative models are developed for many evolutionary processes. Such models include that for selection, multicellularity, coevolution, sexual reproduction, and the Serengeti Rules. Numerous examples of biological phenomena are shown to be in conceptual agreement with the models. In the end, the physics shows how complex design can arise automatically\"--", "title_en": "The physics of evolution"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4152440-8", "gnd:4006891-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1296073939", "year": "2023", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Inspired by Emerson's writings on the need to align exterior expression with interior self, Wright believed that architecture was not first and foremost a matter of accommodating spatial needs, but a tool to restore intellectual and artistic freedom, long lost in the process of modernization. Ayad Rahmani shows that Emerson's writings provide an avenue for interpreting Wright's complex approach to country and architecture. The two thinkers cohered around a common concern for a nation derailed by forces that were not only nefarious, but which also flew in the face of the country's original promise. In Emerson's condemnations of slavery and inequality, Wright found inspiration for seeking redress against the humiliations suffered by the modern worker, be it at the hands of an industrial manager or office boss. His designs sought to challenge dehumanizing labor practices and open minds to the beauty and science of agriculture and the natural world. Emerson's example helped Wright develop architecture that aimed less at accommodating a culture of clients and more at raising national historical awareness while also arguing for humane and equitable policies. As evidence of these interventions, Rahmani details the genesis of recent developments in urban agriculture, rooftop gardens, and cohousing.

Our main result yields a complete structural description of cubic couplings, using nilspaces. We give three applications. Firstly, we describe the characteristic factors of Host-Kra type seminorms for measure-preserving actions of countable nilpotent groups. This yields an extension of the structure theorem of Host and Kra. Secondly, we characterize sequences of random variables with a property that we call cubic exchangeability. These are sequences indexed by the infinite discrete cube, such that for every integer k [geq] 0 the joint distribution's marginals on affine subcubes of dimension k are all equal. In particular, our result gives a description, in terms of compact nilspaces, of a related exchangeability property considered by Austin, inspired by a problem of Aldous. Finally, using nilspaces we obtain limit objects for sequences of functions on compact abelian groups (more generally on compact nilspaces) such that the densities of certain patterns in these functions converge.

Arabic printing began in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Levant through the association of the scholar and printer Antim the Iberian, later a metropolitan of Wallachia, and Athanasios III Dabbās, twice patriarch of Antioch, when the latter, as metropolitan of Aleppo, was sojourning in Bucharest. This partnership resulted in the first Greek and Arabic editions of the Book of the Divine Liturgies (Snagov, 1701) and the Horologion (Bucharest, 1702). With the tools and expertise that he acquired in Wallachia, Dabbās established in Aleppo in 1705 the first Arabic-type press in the Ottoman Empire. After the Church of Antioch divided into separate Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic Patriarchates in 1724, a new press was opened for Arabic-speaking Greek Catholics by ʻAbdallāh Zāḫir in Ḫinšāra (Ḍūr al-Šuwayr), Lebanon. Likewise, in 1752-1753, a press active at the Church of Saint George in Beirut printed Orthodox books that preserved elements of the Aleppo editions and were reprinted for decades.

To solve the inverse problem for Schrödinger operators on metric graphs the magnetic boundary control method is introduced. Spectral data depending on the magnetic flux allow one to solve the inverse problem in full generality, this means to reconstruct not only the potential on a given graph, but also the underlying graph itself and the vertex conditions. The book provides an excellent example of recent studies where the interplay between different fields like operator theory, algebraic geometry and number theory, leads to unexpected and sound mathematical results.

This graduate text presents the elegant and profound theory of continuous parameter Markov processes and many of its applications.

After a review of some background material, the reader is introduced to semigroup theory, including the Hille–Yosida Theorem, used to construct continuous parameter Markov processes. Illustrated with examples, it is a cornerstone of Feller’s seminal theory of the most general one-dimensional diffusions studied in a later chapter. This is followed by two chapters with probabilistic constructions of jump Markov processes, and processes with independent increments, or Lévy processes. The greater part of the book is devoted to Itô’s fascinating theory of stochastic differential equations, and to the study of asymptotic properties of diffusions in all dimensions, such as explosion, transience, recurrence, existence of steady states, and the speed of convergence to equilibrium. A broadly applicable functional central limit theorem for ergodic Markov processes is presented with important examples. Intimate connections between diffusions and linear second order elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations are laid out in two chapters, and are used for computational purposes.

In order to understand the language of a building we might look to the detail of the window. But what does this mean and why does modern architecture invest so much expression in the window?

This book lays the foundation for a theory of coarse groups: namely, sets with operations that satisfy the group axioms “up to uniformly bounded error”. These structures are the group objects in the category of coarse spaces, and arise naturally as approximate subgroups, or as coarse kernels. The first aim is to provide a standard entry-level introduction to coarse groups. Extra care has been taken to give a detailed, self-contained and accessible account of the theory. The second aim is to quickly bring the reader to the forefront of research. This is easily accomplished, as the subject is still young, and even basic questions remain unanswered. Reflecting its dual purpose, the book is divided into two parts. The first part covers the fundamentals of coarse groups and their actions. Here the theory of coarse homomorphisms, quotients and subgroups is developed, with proofs of coarse versions of the isomorphism theorems, and it is shown how coarse actions are related to fundamental aspects of geometric group theory. The second part, which is less self-contained, is an invitation to further research, where each thread leads to open questions of varying depth and difficulty. Among other topics, it explores coarse group structures on set-groups, groups of coarse automorphisms and spaces of controlled maps. The main focus is on connections between the theory of coarse groups and classical subjects, including: number theory; the study of bi-invariant metrics on groups; quasimorphisms and stable commutator length; groups of outer automorphisms; and topological groups and their actions.

This important new book enhances our understanding of the dynamic interactions between economic activity, economic growth, pollution abatement and environmental policy. It addresses one main policy problem: how can the direct and indirect costs of environmental policy for multiple pollutants be properly assessed in an applied model? Using an original methodology, the author constructs a multi-sectoral dynamic applied general equilibrium model. This new integrated model greatly improves the empirical analysis of the dynamic reactions of economic agents to pollution control, explicitly taking into account the direct and indirect effects of abatement on the economy and the environment. The author goes on to apply the model to study the costs of various environmental policies including climate change, acidification, eutrophication, smog formation and the dispersion of fine dust. He finds that if environmental policies can be implemented simultaneously and in a cost-effective manner, the economic costs of these policies can be effectively limited through a combination of economic restructuring and adopting technical abatement measures.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1879443481", "content": {"text": "The anatomy and evolution of industries : technological change and industrial dynamics. In this challenging book, Orietta Marsili examines the relationship between industrial dynamics and technological change. By combining formal evolutionary modelling with empirical evidence, she illustrates how the characteristics of innovative processes in different technological regimes influence market structure and dynamics. The book is divided into three sections; part one provides the analytical background, part two identifies the characteristics of technological regimes and part three develops a formal evolutionary model which links technological regimes to the dynamics of industrial competition and accounts for empirical regularities identified earlier in the book. Significantly, the author introduces a new taxonomy of technical regimes, which groups sets of production activities together - an important and valuable step away from traditional industrial classifications. The author concludes by stressing the usefulness of industrial regimes, proposing directions for future research and outlining the elements which must be considered if the relationship between industrial dynamics and technological change is to be fully understood. This innovative book will be welcomed by those in the fields of industrial economics, evolutionary economics, the economics of innovation and technological change and public policymakers", "title_en": "The anatomy and evolution of industries : technological change and industrial dynamics"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4431027-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Edward Elgar Publishing", "year": "2001", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Korea has been at the centre of intense debate concerning the role of government in economic development. Taking an in-depth approach, this book analyses the path of Korea's industrial technology development. In contrast to many previous studies on Korea, the author argues that the role of foreign multinational enterprises has been significant while the government's was surprisingly limited in scope. The author addresses three main questions: * How was Korea able to develop so effectively despite the low inflow of foreign technologies and capital? * What is the role of multinational enterprises in 'teaching' technology to the firms from developing countries? * What has been the influence of public policy on Korea's technology development? The author demonstrates that the key to the Korean electronics industry's spectacular growth has been through its participation in and learning from an inter-firm arrangement called 'original equipment manufacturing' (OEM) arrangement, and a number of firm-level case studies support this argument. This book will be of special interest to scholars of industrial and development economics, innovation and Asian studies.

Japan presents a unique context for conducting queer studies. Unlike Europe, North America, and other regions of the world, it is said to lack homophobia due to the absence of Christianity as moral foundation. Furthermore, the situation of LGBTQ+ people has changed rapidly over the past ten years, as the Tokyo Olympics provided another impulse for discussions about sexual minority rights. As a result, recent surveys show a dramatic increase in the acceptance of same-sex marriage. However, Japan is the only G7 country that does not recognize same-sex partnerships and sexual minorities are not legally protected from discrimination. This is due to deeply rooted traditional and religiously tainted family values, represented and perpetuated by post-war Japan's deeply conservative political establishment. While LGBTQ+ issues in Japan have received scholarly attention since the 1990s, there is little scholarship in English on developments after 2000, let alone in the form of anthologies. This volume will bridge this gap by shedding light on political and cultural representations of and by sexual minorities in Japan after 2000, making, thus, available in English a completely novel perspective on LGBTQ+ issues in Japan and East Asia", "title_en": "Beyond diversity : queer politics, activism, and representation in contemporary Japan"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:7705503-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2024", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

This contributed volume overviews recently presented approaches for carrying out QSPR/QSAR analysis by using a simplifying molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) to represent the molecular structure. In contrast to traditional SMILES, quasi-SMILES is a sequence of special symbols-codes that reflect molecular features and codes of experimental conditions. SMILES and quasi-SMILES serve as a basis to develop QSPR/QSAR as well Nano-QSPR/QSAR via the Monte Carlo calculation that provides the so-called optimal descriptors for QSPR/QSAR models. The book presents a reliable technology for developing Nano-QSPR/QSAR while it also includes the description of the algorithms of the Monte Carlo optimization. It discusses the theory and practice of the technique of variational authodecoders (VAEs) based on SMILES and analyses in detail the index of ideality of correlation (IIC) and the correlation intensity index (CII) which are new criteria for the predictive potential of the model. The mathematical apparatus used is simple so that students of relevant specializations can easily follow.

Verlagsinfo: Susanne Schmidt and Raymund Werle present three case studies from the telecommunications industry to highlight the actors, the process, the politics, and the influence exerted by international organizations in the construction of standards. Few modern technologies are designed to stand alone. Because most machines must now fit into systems and be compatible with other technologies, the creation of standards has become a fundamental element of design and engineering. Conflicts such as the \"color television war\" of the 1970s and recent disputes over high-definition television (HDTV) highlight the complexities of the standard-setting process. Susanne Schmidt and Raymund Werle present three case studies from the telecommunications industry to highlight the actors, the process, the politics, and the influence exerted by international organizations in the construction of standards. The case studies include the standards for facsimile terminals and transmission, videotex (a service that, with the exception of the French Minitel service, largely failed), and for electronic mail. The authors follow each trail from the realization by certain actors of the need for a standard, through the complex negotiation processes involving many economic, political, and social interests, to the final agreement on a standard. Throughout their stories, they emphasize the institutional embeddedness of these processes, demonstrating the value of an institutionalist approach to technology studies.", "title_en": "Coordinating technology : studies in the international standardization of telecommunications"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4191427-2", "gnd:4184642-4", "gnd:4162052-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:137009356; gnd:170624390", "year": "1998", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

To protect mobile agents from attacks by their execution environments, or hosts, one class of protection mechanisms uses 'reference states' to detect modification attacks. Reference states are agent states that have been produced by non-attacking, or reference hosts. This paper examines this class of mechanisms and present the bandwidth of the achieved protection. First, a new general definition of attacks against mobile agents is presented. As this general definition does not lead to a practicable protection scheme, the notion of reference states is introduced. This notion allows to define a protection scheme that can be used to practically realize a whole number of mechanisms to protect mobile agents. Therefore, after an initial analysis of already existing approaches, the abstract features of these approaches are extracted. A discussion examines the strengths and weaknesses of the general protection scheme, and a framework is presented that allows an agent programmer to choose a level of protection using the reference states scheme. An example illustrates the usage of the framework, measurements present the overhead of the framework for the case of the example mechanism.", "title_en": "A framework to protect mobile agents by using reference states"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4180271-8", "gnd:4128252-8", "gnd:4455389-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2000", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A342764063", "content": {"text": "Leviathan in cyberspace : how to tax e-commerce. Because of the upswing in electronic commerce via the Internet, governments in the European Union and the United States have been discussing the shaping of an effective system of turnover taxation in cyberspace since the late 1990s, but have failed to agree on a definite tax system. In the Kiel Discussion Paper 384, Jürgen Stehn discusses alternative approaches.¤ An analysis of the various possible approaches to turnover taxation in cyberspace shows that the main challenge of the new economy is to effectively cope with business-to- consumer (B2C) transborder trade in digital on-line goods and services. However, the traditional systems of turnover taxation that are based on the country-of-destination principle such as the transitional system of the European Union, the sales tax system, the community principle, and the VIVAT and CVAT approaches give rise to several surveillance, efficiency, incentive, and identification problems in taxing B2C e-commerce. This is also the case with the more innovative proposals that have been made with regard to the taxation of B2C transborder trade in digital on-line goods, such as the German payment flow proposal, the U.S. e-card proposal, the modified country-of-origin proposal of the EU Commission, or the bit tax proposal. As a consequence, the author concludes, there are only two appropriate approaches to deal with the special characteristics of transborder trade in cyberspace: the country-of-origin principle combined with a taxation of digital goods and services at the physical location of producers, and the community principle in combination with a withholding tax (WITHVAT). Under the country-of-origin principle, exports are taxed at the rate of the country of origin and imports are free of tax. The taxation of goods turnovers at the physical location of the firms involved could at least partly prevent the transfer of Internet firms to low-tax countries. The main advantage of the country-of-origin principle is that it does not require any transborder tax adjustment and that it is also a suitable and effective approach for the turnover taxation of traditional off-line and on-line goods. However, the country-of-origin principle requires an administratively burdensome central clearinghouse system in order to guarantee the regional fiscal assignment according to the country-of-destination principle as demanded by the governments of the EU member states. Under the WITHVAT system, exports of digital on-line goods are taxed at the rate of the country of destination and consumers are responsible for passing the tax funds on to their national tax authorities. In order to set incentives for consumers to correctly report their digital on-line purchases to national tax authorities, all suppliers of digital online goods would be forced to add a withholding tax that equals the highest VAT rate of all countries participating in the transborder VAT system to any sales to consumers. Consumers would get a refund according to the difference between the withholding tax and the tax rate of the country of destination if they presented the bills to their national tax authorities. The main advantage of the WITHVAT approach is that it does not need a central clearinghouse mechanism, because decentralized clearing is endogenous in the system. However, the WITHVAT approach may give rise to an unspecificable obstacle to e-commerce and is not a suitable approach for the taxation of traditional off-line and on-line goods, the author concludes.", "title_en": "Leviathan in cyberspace : how to tax e-commerce"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4308416-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:133125351", "year": "2002", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Transboundary transport of air pollution has been a topic of scientific research for several decades and has also been addressed already by environmental policies. However, the importance of air pollution transport on the largest - intercontinental - scales, has been recognized only recently. It was soon found that the meteorological and chemical processes involved in intercontinental pollution transport are distinctly different from those occurring during regional-scale transport, and thus new scientific methodologies are required for their study. In this book, leading scientists review the current state of knowledge in this emerging field of research, providing the reader with a process understanding of global-scale transport and its influence on the atmosphere's chemical composition. Long-range transport of anthropogenic pollution is contrasted with that of pollution produced by natural processes such as dust storms or forest fires. Furthermore, the prospects for international management of intercontinental transport of anthropogenic pollution are discussed.

These processes are far too complex for analytic and numerical methods and are best described by PDEs with rapidly oscillating coefficients - a technique that has become increasingly important in the last three decades due to its multiple applications in the areas of optimization, radiophysics, filtration theory, rheology, elasticity theory, and other domains of mechanics, physics, and technology. The present monograph is a comprehensive study of homogenization problems describing various physical processes in micro-inhomogeneous media. From the technical viewpoint the work focuses on the construction of nonstandard models for media characterized by several small-scale parameters (multiscale models). A variety of techniques are used --- specifically functional analysis, the spectral theory for differential operators, the Laplace transform, and, most importantly, a new variational PDE method for studying the asymptotic behavior of solutions of stationary boundary value problems. This new method can be applied to a wide variety of problems. Key topics in this systematic exposition include asymptotic analysis, Dirichlet- and Neumann-type boundary value problems, differential equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients, homogenization, homogenized and non-local models. Along with complete proofs of all main results, numerous examples of typical structures of micro-inhomogeneous media with their corresponding homogenized models are provided. Applied mathematicians, advanced-level graduate students, physicists, engineers, and specialists in mechanics will benefit from this monograph, which may be used in the classroom or as a comprehensive reference text.

The technique of in vitro cultivation of root organs was developed over the last decades and opens new ways for studying plant-fungi associations. It is a technical breakthrough, especially for the investigation of the ubiquitous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, since these obligate symbionts rely on plant tissue. This is the first book describing this unique in vitro cultivation, which has markedly improved our general understanding of symbiosis. Presented by an international group of authors, including pioneers of this technique, it should encourage researchers to apply the method in further new studies on mycorrhizal fungi and plant-fungi interactions. Various biological aspects such as the physiology, biochemistry, biodiversity and life cycles of fungi as well as the effects of symbiosis on plant growth and development are described, including large-scale fungus production for biotechnological use.

New Yorker writer Kolbert tackles the controversial subject of global warming. Americans have been warned since the late 1970s that the buildup of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere threatens to melt the polar ice sheets and irreversibly change our climate. With little done since then to alter this dangerous course, now is the moment to salvage our future. By the end of the century, the world will likely be hotter than it's been in the last two million years, and the sweeping consequences of this change will determine the future of life on earth for generations to come. Kolbert approaches this monumental problem from every angle.

Even today there are problems that plague the history of technology as regards its relationship to the histories of economics, of science, and of culture. A sinister and disquieting unease is felt by anyone who takes an interest in the subject and attempts to define the disciplinary boundaries, making use of categories and shared concepts of knowledge of the longest tradition. - - Historians of technology, science, architecture, and engineering (among other fields) were and are ready to establish boundaries and drive stakes to distinguish the pure from the contaminated, to advise on partnerships and discourage dangerous alliances. As always happens in such case, the advisers far outnumbered the good advice and from the disciplinary barracks, often of a small academic nature, flowed volleys of messages that were subtly threatening, as if research feared liberty and should be constrained by written declarations of appurtenance. Contemporaneously on the opposite front are thrown together \"insurrectional\" proclamations, everyone having to have his say, without getting touching the seriousness of the research and the rigorousness of the methods of investigation. - - The Associazione Benvenuto for research in the Science and Art of Building in their historical development is not enrolling in either camp. Rather, we decided to assign to a few international \"observers\" the task of styling a map of Construction History in their various countries. Obviously, we are not dealing here with an exhaustive map, but rather with a first attempt to identify some of the significant lines of research and to put into contact the individual scholars. A small step towards the constitution of an international scientific community that is interested in architecture as well as mechanics; in construction as well as its history. A community which, up to the present, has not known how to find the essential points of contact and dialogue, and which has avoided the onus of long-term initiatives. It is our hope that the present volume will be helpful in establishing solid collaborative research projects, knowing that this can happen only if the studies are so rigorous and detailed that those emphatic recall to arms of interdisciplinarity, sure signs of problems set forth badly, are rendered superfluous", "title_en": "Construction history : research perspectives in Europe"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4004955-3", "gnd:4002851-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:10084858-8", "year": "2004", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Optimization problems in practice are diverse and evolve over time, giving rise to - quirements both for ready-to-use optimization software packages and for optimization software libraries, which provide more or less adaptable building blocks for app- cation-specific software systems. In order to apply optimization methods to a new type of problem, corresponding models and algorithms have to be “coded” so that they are accessible to a computer. One way to achieve this step is the use of a mod- ing language. Such modeling systems provide an excellent interface between models and solvers, but only for a limited range of model types (in some cases, for example, linear) due, in part, to limitations imposed by the solvers. Furthermore, while m- eling systems especially for heuristic search are an active research topic, it is still an open question as to whether such an approach may be generally successful. Modeling languages treat the solvers as a “black box” with numerous controls. Due to variations, for example, with respect to the pursued objective or specific problem properties, - dressing real-world problems often requires special purpose methods. Thus, we are faced with the difficulty of efficiently adapting and applying appropriate methods to these problems.

A course in angular momentum techniques is essential for quantitative study of problems in atomic physics, molecular physics, nuclear physics and solid state physics. This book has grown out of such a course given to the students of the M. Sc. and M. Phil. degree courses at the University of Madras. An elementary knowledge of quantum mechanics is an essential pre-requisite to undertake this course but no knowledge of group theory is assumed on the part of the readers. Although the subject matter has group-theoretic origin, special efforts have been made to avoid the gro- theoretical language but place emphasis on the algebraic formalism dev- oped by Racah (1942a, 1942b, 1943, 1951). How far I am successful in this project is left to the discerning reader to judge. After the publication of the two classic books, one by Rose and the other by Edmonds on this subject in the year 1957, the application of angular momentum techniques to solve physical problems has become so common that it is found desirable to organize a separate course on this subject to the students of physics. It is to cater to the needs of such students and research workers that this book is written. A large number of questions and problems given at the end of each chapter will enable the reader to have a clearer understanding of the subject.", "title_en": "Angular Momentum Techniques in Quantum Mechanics"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4047989-4", "gnd:4150572-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Devanathan, V.", "year": "2002", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Among the most famous examples of this type of systems are the dispersion management in fiber-optic telecommunication links, and (more recently) photonic crystals. A number of other systems belonging to the same broad class of spatially periodic strongly inhomogeneous media (such as the split-step and tandem models) have recently been identified in nonlinear optics, and transmission of solitary pulses in them was investigated in detail. Similar soliton dynamics occurs in temporal-domain counterparts of such systems, where they are subject to strong time-periodic modulation (for instance, the Feshbach-resonance management in Bose-Einstein condensates). Basis results obtained for all these systems are reviewed in the book.

Thus, chaotic signals can be used instead of pseudo-random digital sequences for spread-spectrum and private communication applications. This deceptively simple idea spun hundreds of research papers, and many novel communication schemes based on chaotic signals have been proposed. However, only very recently researchers have begun to make a transition from academic studies toward practical implementation issues, and many \"\"promising\"\" schemes had to be discarded or re-formulated. This book describes the state of the art (both theoretical and experimental) of this novel field.

MTDSC provides a step-change increase in the power of calorimetry to characterize virtually all polymer systems including curing systems, blends and semicrystalline polymers. It enables hidden transitions to be revealed, miscibility to be accurately assessed, and phases and interfaces in complex blends to be quantified. It also enables crystallinity in complex systems to be measured and provides new insights into melting behaviour. All of this is achieved by a simple modification of conventional DSC. In 1992 a new calorimetric technique was introduced that superimposed a small modulation on top of the conventional linear temperature program typically used in differential scanning calorimetry. This was combined with a method of data analysis that enabled the sample's response to the linear component of the temperature program to be separated from its response to the periodic component. In this way, for the first time, a signal equivalent to that of conventional DSC was obtained simultaneously with a measure of the sample's heat capacity from the modulation. The new information this provided sparked a revolution in scanning calorimetry by enabling new insights to be gained into almost all aspects of polymer characteristics. This book provides both a basic and advanced treatment of the theory of the technique followed by a detailed exposition of its application to reacting systems, blends and semicrystalline polymers by the leaders in all of these fields.

Schuster in 1898, was actually predicted by P.A.M. Dirac in the late 19-twenties in the negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation. Its existence was subsequently confirmed via the Wilson chamber and became an established part of theoretical physics. Dirac soon discovered that particles with negative energy do not behave in a physically conventional manner, and he therefore developed his \"\"hole theory\"\". This restricted the study of antimatter to the sole level of second quantization. As a result antimatter created a scientific imbalance, because matter was treated at all levels of study, while antimatter was treated only at the level of second quantization. In search of a new mathematics for the resolution of this imbalance the author conceived what we know today as Santilli s isodual mathematics, which permitted the construction of isodual classical mechanics, isodual quantization and isodual quantum mechanics. The scope of this monograph is to show that our classical, quantum and cosmological knowledge of antimatter is at its beginning with much yet to be discovered, and that a commitment to antimatter by experimentalists will be invaluable to antimatter science.\"", "title_en": "Isodual Theory of Antimatter : with applications to Antigravity, Grand Unification and Cosmology"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4114294-9", "gnd:4158251-2", "gnd:4142686-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Santilli, Ruggero Maria", "year": "2006", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Taken as a whole, the Encyclopedia surveys basic environmental science and applied areas of study, and is drawn from the physical sciences, life sciences and social sciences. The 228 authors from 25 different countries, many of whom are the leading authorities in their field, include biologists, ecologists, geographers, geologists, political scientists, soil scientists, hydrologists, climatologists, and representatives of many other disciplines and academic specialties. The work, which is amply referenced and cross-referenced, consists of substantial essays on major topics, medium-sized entries and short definitional entries. The shorter entries include useful biographies of leading scientists and environmentalists. The Encyclopedia will be invaluable to all readers interested in the environment of life on Earth, its past, present and future, and its physical and social dimensions. The text provides a source of well-classified basic information as well as covering the leading theories and important debates in the environmental sciences. In addition, the book also includes assessments of the future prospects for the Earth's environment in the face of pollution, population increases and the accelerating transformation of land, air, water and vegetational systems. The Encyclopedia is unique in presenting both a basic overview and detailed information on environmental topics and is suitable for the general scientific reader and the specialized environmental scientist in academic institutions, research laboratories or private practice.", "title_en": "Environmental Geology"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4121810-3", "gnd:4061650-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "1999", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Boundary-Scan Basics and Vocabulary -- Boundary-Scan Description Language (BSDL) -- Boundary-Scan Testing -- Advanced Boundary-Scan Topics -- Design for Boundary-Scan Test -- Analog Measurement Basics -- IEEE 1149.4 Analog Boundary-Scan. Boundary-Scan, formally known as IEEE/ANSI Standard 1149.1-1990, is a collection of design rules applied principally at the Integrated Circuit (IC) level that allow software to alleviate the growing cost of designing, producing and testing digital systems. A fundamental benefit of the standard is its ability to transform extremely difficult printed circuit board testing problems that could only be attacked with ad-hoc testing methods into well-structured problems that software can easily deal with. IEEE standards, when embraced by practicing engineers, are living entities that grow and change quickly. The Boundary-Scan Handbook, Second Edition: Analog and Digital is intended to describe these standards in simple English rather than the strict and pedantic legalese encountered in the standards. The 1149.1 standard is now over eight years old and has a large infrastructure of support in the electronics industry. Today, the majority of custom ICs and programmable devices contain 1149.1. New applications for the 1149.1 protocol have been introduced, most notably the `In-System Configuration' (ISC) capability for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The Boundary-Scan Handbook, Second Edition: Analog and Digital updates the information about IEEE Std. 1149.1, including the 1993 supplement that added new silicon functionality and the 1994 supplement that formalized the BSDL language definition. In addition, the new second edition presents completely new information about the newly approved 1149.4 standard often termed `Analog Boundary-Scan'. Along with this is a discussion of Analog Metrology needed to make use of 1149.1. This forms a toolset essential for testing boards and systems of the future.", "title_en": "The Boundary-Scan Handbook : Analog and Digital"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4367264-4", "gnd:4019627-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Parker, Kenneth P.", "year": "2002", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}
{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A524977038", "content": {"text": "Analog Design for CMOS VLSI Systems. Analog Design for CMOS VLSI Systems is a comprehensive text that offers a detailed study of the background principles and the analog design techniques for CMOS-VLSI implementation. The book covers the physical operation and the modelling of MOS transistors. Discusses the key features of integrated passive components and studies basic building blocks and voltage and current references before considering in great details the design of op-amps and comparators. The book is primarily intended for use as a graduate-level textbook and for practising engineers. It is expected that the reader should be familiar with the concepts taught in basic introductory courses in analog circuits. Relying on that proper background knowledge the book presents the material on an intuitive basis with a minimum use of mathematical quantitative analysis. Therefore, the insight induced by the book will favour that kind of knowledge gathering required for the design of high-performance analog circuits. The book favours this important process with a number of inserts providing hints or advises on key features of the topic studied. An interesting peculiarity of the book is the use of numbers. The equations describing the circuit operation are guidelines for the designer. It is important to assess performances in a quantitative way. To achieve this target the book provides a number of examples on computer simulations using Spice. Moreover, in order to acquire the feeling of the technological progress, three different hypothetical technologies are addressed and used. Detailed examples and the many problems make Analog Design for CMOS VLSI Systems a comprehensive textbook for a graduate-level course on analog circuit design. Moreover, the book will efficiently serve the practical needs of a wide range of circuit design and system design engineers.

Systematic Design for Optimisation of Pipelined ADCs proposes and develops new strategies, methodologies and tools for designing low-power and low-area CMOS pipelined A/D converters. The task is tackled by following a scientifically-consistent approach. First of all, the state of the art in pipeline A/D converters is analysed with a double purpose: a) to identify the best suited among different strategies reported in literature and taking into account the objectives pursued; b) to identify the drawbacks of these strategies as a basic first step to improve them. Then, the book proposes a top-down design approach for implementing high-performance low-power and low-area CMOS pipelined A/D converters through: The conception, development and implementation of self-calibrated techniques to extend the linearity of some critical stages in the architecture of pipelined ADCs. The detailed analysis and modelling of some major non-idealities that limit the physical realisation of pipelined ADCs and the proposal, development and implementation of design methodologies to support systematic design of optimised instances of these converters which combine maximum performance with minimum power dissipation and minimum area occupation. £/LIST£ Several implementations together with consistent measured results are presented. In particular, a practical realisation of a low-power 14-bit 5MS/s CMOS pipelined ADC with background analogue self-calibration is fully described. The proposed approach is fully in line with the best practice regarding the design of mixed-signal integrated circuits. On the one hand, drawbacks of currently existing solutions are overcame through innovative strategies and, on the other hand, the expert knowledge is packaged and made available for re-usability by the community of circuit designers. Finally, feasibility of the strategies and the associated encapsulated knowledge is granted through experimental validation of working silicon. Systematic Design for Optimisation of Pipelined ADCs serves as an excellent reference for analogue design engineers especially designers of low-power CMOS A/D converters.

Fiber Reinforced Plastics (FRP) are widely used for the design of load-bearing structures.

Analysis of Failure in Fiber Polymer Laminates presents Alfred Puck´s failure model, which, among several other theories, predicts fracture limits best and describes the failure phenomena in FRP most realistically – as confirmed within the \"World-wide Failure Exercise\". Using Puck´s model the composite engineer can follow the gradual failure process in a laminate and deduce from the results of the analysis how to improve the laminate design. This capability distinguishes the model from other phenomenological and global models. It thus reduces the number of required component tests and iteration loops in the design process and paves the way to sorely needed software for crash-simulation of FRP-structures.

It looks at examples where the environment provides expected cues for normal development and where the organism develops improperly without such cues. Data from research on teratology, endocrine disruptors, and microbial symbioses, when integrated into a developmental context, may have enormous implications for human health as well as the overall health of Earth's ecosystems. The study of epigenetics--changes in gene expression that are not the result of changes in a gene's DNA sequence--has recently provided startling insights not only into mechanisms of development, but also into the mechanisms and processes of evolution. The notion that epialleles (changes in chromosome structure that alter gene expression) can be induced by environmental agents and transmitted across generations has altered our notions of evolution, as have new experiments documenting the genetic fixation of environmentally induced changes in development. The widespread use of symbiosis in development provides new targets for natural selection. Ecological developmental biology integrates these new ideas into an extended evolutionary synthesis that retains and enriches the notion of evolution by natural selection.\"--Publisher's description", "title_en": "Ecological developmental biology : integrating epigenetics, medicine, and evolution"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4152503-6", "gnd:4152449-4", "gnd:4248244-6", "gnd:4071050-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:133098559; gnd:1078458375", "year": "2009", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Attacks to network infrastructure affect large portions of the Internet at a time and create large amounts of service disruption, due to breaches such as IP spoofing, routing table poisoning and routing loops. Daily operations around the world highly depend on the availability and reliability of the Internet, which makes the security of this infrastructure a top priority issue in the field. Network Infrastructure Security is a book that bridges the gap between the study of the traffic flow of networks and the study of the actual network configuration. This book makes effective use of examples and figures to illustrate network infrastructure attacks from a theoretical point of view.

Then, the neuronal circuitry of the retina is analyzed in terms of spatio-temporal filtering. This basic model is extended to the concept of neuromorphic circuits for motion processing and to the processing of color in the retina. For more in-depth studies, the adaptive non-linear properties of the photoreceptors and of ganglion cells are addressed, exhibiting all the power of the retinal pre-processing of images as a system of information cleaning suitable for further cortical processing. As a target of retinal information, the primary visual area is presented as a bank of filters able to extract valuable descriptors of images, suitable for categorization and recognition and also for local information extraction such as saliency and perspective.

Aaronson, this collection of lecture notes details the fundamental principles of phase transformations in metals and alloys upon which steel and other metals industries are based. Mechanisms of Diffusional Phase Transformations in Metals and Alloys is devoted to solid-solid phase transformations in which elementary atomic processes are diffusional jumps, and these processes occur in a series of so-called nucleation and growth through interface migration. Instead of relying strictly on a pedagogical approach, it documents the evolution of phase transformation concepts. The authors present topics by describing a phenomenon and then following up with a corresponding hypothesis or alternative explanation. In this way, the book also shows how the field continues to evolve and meet new challenges. Integrated with information from a number of key papers and review articles, this volume reflects this revered and influential instructor's unique and passionate way of introducing well-established theories and knowledge in a systematic way, at the same time introducing, in great detail, how a new idea or interpretation of a phenomenon has emerged, evolved, and gained its current status. If the published version of a theory or a model was too condensed, Aaronson worked the problem out in painstaking detail so that graduate students could follow the derivations.

This collection of essays analyses the reform experiences of the 30 OECD countries in nine major policy domains in order to identify lessons, pitfalls and strategies that may help foster policy reform in the future. While taking full account of the tremendous differences in the political and institutional settings in which these reforms were undertaken, the authors highlight a number of common challenges and potential solutions that hold good across both countries and issue areas. They show that the scope for cross-national policy learning is enormous. The importance of such reform lessons is all the greater in the wake of the global financial and economic crisis. As OECD governments confront the challenge of trying to restore public finances to health without undermining the recovery, they will need to pursue a careful mix of fiscal policies and growth-enhancing structural reforms.

It may at first seem that the world of subatomic physics is far removed from our every day lives. Isn`t it all just a waste of time and taxpayers` money? Hopefully, all who read this book will come to a different conclusion. Collider physics is all about our origins, and this aspect alone makes it worthy of our very best attention. The experiments conducted within the vast collider chambers are at the forefront of humanity`s quest to unweave the great tapestry that is the universe. Everything is connected. Within the macrocosm is the microcosm. By knowing how matter is structured, how atoms and elementary particles interact, and what forces control the interactions between the particles, we discover further clues as to why the universe is the way it is, and we uncover glimpses of how everything came into being. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in the process of coming online at CERN, is the world`s largest and most complex machine. It represents the pinnacle of human ingenuity, and its physical characteristics, costs, and workings astound us at every turn.We are literally humbled by the machine that has been produced through a grand international collaboration of scientists. This book is about what those scientists hope to discover with the LHC, for hopes do run high, and there is much at stake. Careers, reputations and prestigious science prizes will be realized, and possibly lost, in the wake of the results that the LHC will produce. And there are risks, real and imagined. The LHC will probe the very fabric of matter and it will help us understand the very weft and the weave of the universe.", "title_en": "The Large Hadron Collider : Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4037940-1", "gnd:4398783-7", "gnd:4059318-6", "gnd:4003311-9", "gnd:4174609-0", "gnd:4014413-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Beech, Martin", "year": "2010", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Millennialists through the ages have looked forward to the apocalyptic moment that will radically transform society into heaven on earth. They have delivered withering critiques of their own civilizations and promised both the impending annihilation to the forces of evil and the advent of a perfect society. And all their promises have invariably failed. We tend, therefore, to dismiss these prophets of doom and salvation as crackpots and madmen, and not surprisingly historians of our secular era have tended to underestimate their impact on our modern world. Now, Richard Landes offers a lucid and ground-breaking analysis of this widely misunderstood phenomenon. This long-awaited study shows that many events typically regarded as secular--including the French Revolution, Marxism, Bolshevism, Nazism--not only contain key millennialist elements, but follow the apocalyptic curve of enthusiastic launch, disappointment and re-entry into \"normal time.\" Indeed, as Landes examines the explicit millennialism behind such recent events as the emergence of Global Jihad since 1979, he challenges the common notion that modern history is largely motivated by secular interests. By focusing on ten widely different case studies, none of which come from Judaism or Christianity, he shows that millennialism is not only a cultural universal, but also an extremely adaptive social phenomenon that persists across the modern and post-modern divides. At the same time, he also offers valuable insight into the social and psychological factors that drive such beliefs. Ranging from ancient Egypt to modern-day UFO cults and global Jihad, Heaven on Earth both delivers an eye-opening revisionist argument for the significance of millennialism throughout history and alerts the reader to the alarming spread of these ideologies in our world today.", "title_en": "Heaven on earth : the varieties of the millennial experience"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4162689-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:170989577", "year": "2011", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

The main problem in distillation process control is to separate and purify chemical components in liquid and vapor streams while shedding the disturbances that are imposed on the distillation column. The opportunity is to separate the components from a feed stream into new vapor and liquid streams that have increased economic value at a cost that is competitive with other producers. Conducting research in a large corporation provides the opportunity to apply the results of improved performance to many distillation towers in many different businesses\"-- \"With a focus on the fundamentals and strategies of distillation columns, this book covers the process variables for continuous distillation columns, as well as four basic control strategies and the typical cases in which they are used.

After a short overview of the physical principles leading to the linear systems model, a largely self-contained mathematical theory for this model is presented. this includes the geometry of the underlying indefinite eigenvalue problem. Particular attention is paid to the sensitivity issues which influence numerical computations. finally, several recent research developments are included, e.g. Lyapunov stability and the perturbation of the time evolution.\"--P.

Web 2.0 services have imbued the Web as a technical infrastructure with the imprint of human behaviour, and this has consequently attracted attention from many new fields of study including business studies, economics, information science, law, media studies, philosophy, psychology, social informatics and sociology. In fact, to understand the implications of Web 2.0, an interdisciplinary approach is needed, and in writing this book I have been influenced by Web science--a new academic discipline that studies the Web as a large, complex, engineered environment and the impact it has on society. The structure of this book is based on the iceberg model that I initially developed in 2007 as a way of thinking about Web 2.0. I have since elaborated on this and included summaries of important research areas from many different disciplines, which have been brought together as themes. To finish off, I have included a chapter on the future that both draws on the ideas presented earlier in the book and challenges readers to apply them based on what they have learned. Readership The book is aimed at an international audience, interested in forming a deeper understanding of what Web 2.0 might be and how it could develop in the future.

In a few cases, it may be sensible to isolate each variable and study it separately, but in most instances all the variables need to be examined simultaneously in order to fully grasp the structure and key features of the data. For this purpose, one or another method of multivariate analysis might be helpful, and it is with such methods that this book is largely concerned. Multivariate analysis includes methods both for describing and exploring such data and for making formal inferences about them. The aim of all the techniques is, in general sense, to display or extract the signal in the data in the presence of noise and to find out what the data show us in the midst of their apparent chaos. An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R explores the correct application of these methods so as to extract as much information as possible from the data at hand, particularly as some type of graphical representation, via the R software.

This view may be partly due to the relatively few books that focus primarily on how to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of common problems. I believe that the essence of the approach is not only much more relevant to the scientific problems that require statistical thinking and methods, but also much easier to understand and explain to the wider scientific community. But being convinced of the benefits of the Bayesian approach is not enough if the person charged with analyzing the data does not have the computing software tools to implement these methods. Although WinBUGS (Lunn et al. 2000) provides sufficient functionality for the vast majority of data analyses that are undertaken, there is still a steep learning curve associated with the programming language that many will not have the time or motivation to overcome. This book describes a graphical user interface (GUI) for WinBUGS, BugsXLA, the purpose of which is to make Bayesian analysis relatively simple. Since I have always been an advocate of Excel as a tool for exploratory graphical analysis of data (somewhat against the anti-Excel feelings in the statistical community generally), I created BugsXLA as an Excel add-in.

The International System of Units (SI) is based on seven fundamental units from which other units may be derived, but many astronomers are reluctant to drop their old and familiar systems. This handbook demonstrates the ease with which transformations from old units to SI units may be made. Using worked examples, the author argues that astronomers would benefit greatly if the reporting of astronomical research and the sharing of data were standardized to SI units. Each chapter reviews a different SI base unit, clarifying the connection between these units and those currently favoured by astronomers.

As these conditional preferences propagate through a group of decision makers, they create social bonds that lead to notions of group concordance.

In the past hundred years, many theories have been proposed for control system design. However, there are three main problems when some of these advanced control theories are applied to industrial systems: 1. These theories depend on empirical methods or trial-and-error methods in choosing weighting functions. 2. Both the design procedures and results are complicated for under- standing and using. 3. The controllers cannot be designed or tuned for quantitative engineering performance indices (such as overshoot or stability margin). In this book, an improved theory called the Quantitative Process Control Theory is introduced to solve these problems. This new theory has three features: 1. When using the theory, the designer is not required to choose a weighting function. 2. The design is suboptimal and analytical. It is easy to understand and use. 3. The controllers can be designed or tuned for quantitative engineering performance indices. Mathematical proofs are provided in this book for almost all results, especially when they contribute to the understanding of the subjects presented. This will, I believe, enhance the educational value of this book. During the procedure of writing, as few concepts as possible are introduced and as few mathematical tools as possible are employed so as to make the book acces- sible.

As occurs in Twenty Years After, second in the saga of The Three Musketeers, by Alexander Dumas, many changes have occurred during this 20-year time period, beginning with those occurring in my own person. The field of cell wall research is no exception, and the main topics of investigation have oscillated from those mainly centered on the determination of the chemical composition of the wall, and the biochemical and physiological aspects of cell wall growth and expansion, to a field dominated, in great part, by molecular biology and its ramifications. This change is obvious, since it is the wave in biology in general. It is positive because it has brought light to many aspects of the behavior of the cell wall, the synthesis of its main components, and the enzymes involved and their regulation. However, it is negative because many important aspects have been left out because they are not fashionable. With this background, I have dared to take the responsibility of writing this second edition, maybe without taking into consideration that I am probably old-fashioned and perhaps without the necessary background to tackle the new ideas on the subject. But, with the courage to engage in an attractive enterprise and my long interest on the fungal cell wall, I expect to cover these deficiencies.

In the changing world of interwar Europe a longing for stability rose to the surface of social life. Newly developed neighbourhoods and buildings were designed to create the healing community that many people were dreaming of. Various social groups with nationalist, ideological, or religious agendas made this concept of community a cornerstone in their framework and appropriated it to prescribe the relations between architecture and modernity. This book analyses the various ways in which these relations were determined. Most activists/entities encountered the potentialities of modernity, such as technology or mass media, in an accommodating way. In a broad spectrum of actions and proposals - from art exhibitions to séances, photo reports to roof tiles, landscapes to sanitation - these reformists were hoping to create a universe in which their communal dream could become a reality.

We structural engineers are human and so have made a number of errors over the years resulting in narrow escapes, badly performing structures, and even fatal collapses. But as Seneca continues ... sed perseverare diabolicum, we must not repeat our errors. To avoid this means that we must learn from our past mistakes; we must know what went wrong and why. Some of the lessons from our past errors get embodied in clauses in codes of practice, but many do not, and the collective memory of the profession tends to fade as the generation of engineers who learnt from the mishaps and catastrophes retires. Past books on the subject of structural failures tended to deal with the general causes of failures and methods of investigation, illustrated with the more spectacular examples. However, details of some failures that have not made the headlines, but nevertheless hold important lessons, are hard to find or may not even be in the public domain. In the past, Robin Whittle and I worked together at Arup R&D on a variety of problems of concrete structures. Some of these arose from failures, and others were encountered when forestalling undesirable outcomes of the enthusiasm--untempered by experience--of some of our younger colleagues.

A course in a high-level language, such as C usually precedes a course in assembly language. Assembly language programming requires a knowledge of number representations, such as fixed-point, decimal, and floating-point; also digital logic, registers, and stacks. In order to thoroughly understand assembly language, it is necessary to be familiar with the architecture of the computer on which the language is being used. For the X86 assembly language, this implies the Intel and Intel-like microprocessors. Programs written in assembly language are usually faster and more compact than programs written in a high-level language and provide greater control over the program application. Assembly language is machine dependent; that is, it is used only with a specific type of processor. A high-level language, however, is usually machine independent; that is, it can be used with any processor. Assembly language programs use an assembler to convert the assembly language code to the machine language of 1s and 0s. This is in contrast to high-level languages which use compilers to accomplish the transformation. Assembly languages consist of mnemonic codes, which are similar to English words, making the program easy to read. For example, the MOV instruction moves data from a source location to a destination location; the XCHG instruction exchanges the contents of a source location and a destination location; and the logical AND instruction performs the bitwise AND operation of two operands\"--", "title_en": "X86 assembly language and C fundamentals"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4176076-1", "gnd:4003255-3", "gnd:4113195-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Cavanagh, Joseph J.

Biodiversity and ecosystem services provide tangible benefits for society, such as food provisioning, water purification, genetic resources or climate regulation. These services provide critical life support functions and contribute to human health, well being and economic growth. Yet biodiversity is declining worldwide and, in some areas, this loss is accelerating. The need for policies that promote the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and ecosystem services is more important than ever. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) is a direct and flexible incentive-based mechanism under which the user or beneficiary of an ecosystem service makes a direct payment to an individual or community whose land use decisions have an impact on the ecosystem service provision. Interest in PES has been increasing rapidly over the past decade: PES are proliferating worldwide and there are already more than 300 programmes in place today at national, regional and local levels. Drawing on the literature concerning effective PES and on more than 30 case studies from both developed and developing countries, this book aims to identify good practice in the design and implementation of PES programmes so as to enhance their environmental and cost effectiveness. It addresses the following questions: Why are PES useful and how do they work? How can they be made most effective environmentally and how can their cost-effectiveness be maximised? What are the different potential sources of finance for PES programmes, and how can they be secured? and What are the lessons learned from existing PES programmes and insights for future programmes, including international PES?", "title_en": "Paying for Biodiversity : Enhancing the Cost-Effectiveness of Payments for Ecosystem Services"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4601495-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development", "year": "2010", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Although humans have tried to forecast weather for millennia, mathematical principles were used in meteorology only after the turn of the twentieth century. From the first proposal for using mathematics to predict weather, to the supercomputers that now process meteorological information gathered from satellites and weather stations, Ian Roulstone and John Norbury narrate the groundbreaking evolution of modern forecasting. The authors begin with Vilhelm Bjerknes, a Norwegian physicist and meteorologist who in 1904 came up with a method now known as numerical weather prediction. Although his proposed calculations could not be implemented without computers, his early attempts, along with those of Lewis Fry Richardson, marked a turning point in atmospheric science. Roulstone and Norbury describe the discovery of chaos theory's butterfly effect, in which tiny variations in initial conditions produce large variations in the long-term behavior of a system--dashing the hopes of perfect predictability for weather patterns.

Macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in linear, causal media is introduced as a powerful method for understanding and quantifying dispersion forces in a vast range of realistic scenarios. In contrast to the normal-mode quantum electrodynamics traditionally used to study dispersion forces, the new approach allows to consider realistic material properties including absorption and is flexible enough to be applied to a broad range of geometries. The basic physical concepts and theoretical steps lead to the derivation of outlined general expressions for ground-state Casimir, Casimir-Polder and van der Waals forces. As illustrated by a number of examples, these expressions can easily be used to study forces between objects of various shapes and materials, including effects like material absorption, nontrivial magnetic properties and varying object thickness and curvature.

The bacterial communities section reflects the growing realization that studies on pure cultures of bacteria have led to an incomplete picture of the microbial world for two fundamental reasons: the vast majority of bacteria in soil, water and associated with biological tissues are currently not culturable, and that an understanding of microbial ecology requires knowledge on how different bacterial species interact with each other in their natural environment.

In Information Systems, enterprise modelling has been a pivotal field of research that has evolved over a period of more than 20 years. In recent years, the main research focus was on adapting approaches to enterprise modelling to changing requirements, e.g. provide support for IT management. To develop a better understanding of the motivation, objectives and concepts that are characteristic for enterprise modelling, it is important to study the terminological background. On the one hand, it builds the foundation for the conceptualisation of enterprise models, on the other hand, it helps to clarify the semantic relation of the term \"enterprise model\" to terms in its surroundings such as \"information system\", \"conceptual model\" etc. This report is aimed at developing conceptualisations of respective terms. Starting with more generic terms like \"domain\", \"model\" or \"information system\", the course of the investigation gradually moves forward to \"conceptual model\", \"action system\", and \"enterprise model\". Finally, an elaborate conception of multi-perspective enterprise models is presented that is intended to characteristic aspects of their structure, the intentions related to them and preconditions of their reflective use.", "title_en": "Multi-perspective enterprise modelling : background and terminological foundation"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4170297-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:170636143", "year": "2011", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

However, as with any area of applied mathematics, the field of PDEs is interesting not only because of its applications, but because it has taken on a mathematical life of its own. The author has written this book with both ideas in mind, in the hope that the student will appreciate the usefulness of the subject and, at the same time, get a glimpse into the beauty of some of the underlying mathematics. This text is suitable for a two-semester introduction to partial differential equations and Fourier series for students who have had basic courses in multivariable calculus (through Stokes's and the Divergence Theorems) and ordinary differential equations. Over the years, the author has taught much of the material to undergraduate mathematics, physics and engineering students at Penn State and Fairfield Universities, as well as to engineering graduate students at Penn State and mathematics and engineering graduate students at Fairfield. It is assumed that the student has not had a course in real analysis. Thus, we treat pointwise convergence of Fourier series and do not talk about mean-square convergence until Chapter 8 (and, there, in terms of the Riemann, and not the Lebesgue, integral). Further, we feel that it is not appropriate to introduce so subtle an idea as uniform convergence in this setting, so we discuss it only in the Appendices\"--", "title_en": "An introduction to partial differential equations with MATLAB"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4044779-0", "gnd:4329066-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1146591969", "year": "2013", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Modern advanced semiconductor lasers show complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the emitted light. The interaction of light and matter is determined by a variety of nonlinear and quantum-optical processes that occur on various time and length scales. The active medium directly couples the microscopic ultrafast processes of the charge carriers and interband dipoles with the spatio-temporal dynamics of the optical fields. The dynamic interplay of spontaneous and induced emission determines the amplification of ultrashort optical signals and the performance of high-power lasers. Realization of novel waveguide structures and external feedback allow control of laser emission. Quantum dot media provide novel customized gain media by directly harnessing quantum effects. This book presents fundamental theories and simulations of the spatio-temporal dynamics and quantum fluctuations in semiconductor lasers. The dynamic interplay of light and matter is theoretically described by taking into account microscopic carrier dynamics, spatially dependent light field propagation and the influence of spontaneous emission and noise. Computer simulations reveal the internal spatio-temporal dynamics of quantum well and quantum dot in-plane lasers, high-power amplifiers and vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.

Introduction -- Fundamentals of persistence -- Data structures, libraries, and UML -- Advanced features, schema migration -- Languages, their features and limitations -- Automatic persistence for Objective-C -- Benchmark -- Proposal to add a keyword to all OO languages -- The future Recently, the pressure for fast processing and efficient storage of large data with complexrelations increased beyond the capability of traditional databases. Typical examples include iPhone applications, computer aided design - both electrical and mechanical, biochemistry applications, and incremental compilers. Serialization, which is sometimes used in such situations is notoriously tedious and error prone. In this book, Jiri Soukup and Petr MacháČek show in detail how to write programs which store their internal data automatically and transparently to disk. Together with special data structure libraries which treat relations among objects as first-class entities, and with a UML class-diagram generator, the core application code is much simplified. The benchmark chapter shows a typical example where persistent data is faster by the order of magnitude than with a traditional database, in both traversing and accessing the data. The authors explore and exploit advanced features of object-oriented languages in a depth hardly seen in print before. Yet, you as a reader need only a basic knowledge of C++, Java, C♯, or Objective C.

Ronald L. Grimes shows that this debate has stagnated, due in part to a manner of theorizing too far removed from the study of actual religious practices. A worthwhile theory, according to Grimes, must be practice-oriented, and practices are most effectively studied by field research methods. The Craft of Ritual Studies melds together a systematic theory and method capable of underwriting the cross-cultural, interdisciplinary study of ritual enactments. Grimes first exposes the limitations that disable many theories of ritual--for example, defining ritual as essentially religious, assuming that ritual's only function is to generate group solidarity, or treating ritual as a mirror of the status quo. He proposes strategies and offers guidelines for conducting field research on the public performance of rites, providing a guide for fieldwork on complex ritual enactments, particularly those characterized by social conflict or cultural creativity. The volume also provides a section on case study, focusing on a single complex event: the Santa Fe Fiesta, a New Mexico celebration marked by protracted ethnic conflict and ongoing dramatic creativity. Grimes explains how rites interact creatively and critically with their social surroundings, developing such themes as the relation of ritual to media, theater, and film, the dynamics of ritual creativity, the negotiation of ritual criticism, and the impact of ritual on cultural and physical environments.

Having taught both these subjects for over two decades, the authors' experience can be summed up briefly in the following student response: 'These are the best subjects in the curriculum. When you teach it in class, everything is obvious, but when we go back and read the textbook, things get very confusing'. As we got down to decoding this statement, several questions emerged: - Why put students through the gruesome derivation of the sixdegree- of-freedom equations early in the course, preceded by the axis transformations, and followed by the small perturbation math, when the bulk of the course is focussed on the dynamic modes about straight and level flight trim, which can be easily presented without going this route? - Would it not be nicer to write the equations for the second-order modes in a manner similar to a spring-mass-damper system? Then, one could read off the stiffness and damping directly, which would also give the conditions for stability. - The definitions of 'static' and 'dynamic' stability have been the cause of much student heartbreak. With the second-order form of the equations, the requirement of positive stiffness is the same as the socalled 'static' stability condition, so why not drop the separate notion of static stability entirely? -\"--", "title_en": "Elementary flight dynamics with an introduction to bifurcation and continuation methods"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4154760-3", "gnd:4135410-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Ananthkrishnan, N.; Sinha, Nandan K.", "year": "2013", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

Exploring the significance of visual things that are 'under construction' in works by playwrights. Illustrated with examples, it opens up new interpretations of the place of aesthetic form in the early modern imagination.Why are early modern English dramatists preoccupied with unfinished processes of ‘making’ and ‘unmaking’? And what did ‘finished’ or ‘incomplete’ mean for spectators of plays and visual works in this period? Making and unmaking in early modern English drama is about the prevalence and significance of visual things that are ‘under construction’ in early modern plays. Contributing to challenges to the well-worn narrative of ‘iconophobic’ early modern English culture, it explores the drama as a part of a lively post-Reformation visual world. Interrogating the centrality of concepts of ‘fragmentation’ and ‘wholeness’ in critical approaches to this period, it opens up new interpretations of the place of aesthetic form in early modern culture. An interdisciplinary study, this book argues that the idea of ‘finish’ had transgressive associations in the early modern imagination. It centres on the depiction of incomplete visual practices in works by playwrights including Shakespeare, John Lyly, and Robert Greene.

This interest developed into a mission to fully understand all aspects of rock fall behavior and the application of this behavior to the design and construction of protection structures. Lately this mission has evolved into an obsession to help develop improved methods of modeling rock falls and the design of more efficient and cost effective protection structures. As with my other two books, Foundations on Rock and Rock Slope Engineering, the intention of this book is to provide both the theory, and the application of the theory to design. In this book, this approach involves describing five case studies where the impacts are well defined, and then showing how trajectory calculations and impact mechanics can be applied to these actual rock fall conditions. It is hoped that the field data will be useful for calibration of computer rock fall simulation programs. In addition, a wide range of well proven rock fall protection measures are discussed. These discussions describe both design methods, and practical construction experience based on many projects in which the author has been involved. It is intended that users of this book will be both researchers working on the development of rock fall simulation, and practitioners working in the field of rock fall mitigation design and construction.

The quality of telecommunication voice services has become an important issue due to the evolving and liberalized market. With the advent of new technologies, however, a diversification takes place which makes it necessary to carefully plan and observe network quality. Speech communication quality - as it is perceived by the user or customer of a service - carries a multidimensional nature, a fact which must be reflected in its assessment and prediction with quality models. In this book a new schematic is developed which classifies different entities contributing to the quality of a service. It takes into account conversational user as well as service-related contributions. Starting from this concept, perceptively relevant constituents of speech communication quality are identified. A simulation model is developed and implemented, based on physical elements of the transmission configuration. It allows the perceptively most relevant parameters to be simulated, in real time and for the conversation situation. The book gives a valuable overview on assessment needed for reliably measuring the different quality dimensions. For the planning of telephone networks, quality models are presented which aim at predicting mouth-to-ear quality as it would be perceived by a user of the system. These models are an important tool for the planner of telecommunication networks, as they allow the expected quality to be estimated in advance, even before the network has been set up. Two well-known models (the SUBMOD and the E-model) are analyzed in more detail, with an emphasis on the psychoacoustic and psychophysical backgrounds. It turns out that model predictions are satisfactory for many types of degradations, but they can still be improved especially for new types of impairments. Proposals are made for quality model enhancement and combined approaches. Due to its `handbook' character, this book is an invaluable source of background information for anyone working in the field of speech quality assessment as well as telephone network planning and operation.", "title_en": "Assessment and Prediction of Speech Quality in Telecommunications"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4536190-3", "gnd:4129249-2", "gnd:4121257-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:141325011", "year": "2000", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

These transformations concern both the characteristics of productive and innovative processes, and the resources used in these activities. This book captures these changes, where traditional R&D investments undertaken internally by firms are increasingly and strategically complemented by external sources of innovation and new knowledge. Collaborations between firms, and between firms and other organizations, as well as the mobility of human capital, are strategic processes in order to share and circulate knowledge and competencies. They are also key determinants in the creation of new knowledge and innovation, and ultimately in growth dynamics. The circulation and distribution of knowledge is now a key input in the production of knowledge. Knowledge and innovation are understood as the result of collective and interactive processes at the system level, and less at the micro level. In other words, new knowledge production is less and less the result of individualistic behaviours of the firms and much more the effect of explicit and pro-active interactions and transactions put in place by local networks of innovators.

Since the 18th century, one has extensively used techniques such as perturbation methods to obtain approximate analytical solutions of periodic motions in nonlinear systems.

So the bifurcation trees of periodic motions to chaos cannot be achieved analytically. The author has developed an analytical technique that is more effective to achieve periodic motions and corresponding bifurcation trees to chaos analytically.Toward Analytical Chaos in Nonlinear Systems systematically presents a new approach to analytically determine periodic flows to chaos or quasi-periodic flows in nonlinear dynamical systems with/without time-delay. It covers the mathematical theory and includes two examples of nonlinear systems with/without time-delay in engineering and physics.

Since then, the United Nations has recognized access to water as a basic human right-but there is still much work to be done to stem this growing crisis. In this major new book, Barlow draws on her extensive experience and insight to lay out a set of key principles that show the way forward to what she calls a \"water-secure and water-just world.\" Not only does she reveal the powerful players even now impeding the recognition of the human right to water, she argues that water must not become a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market. Focusing on solutions, she includes stories of struggle and resistance from marginalized communities, as well as government policies that work for both people and the planet.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has started to exert a major influence on modern supply chain management. In manufacturing, RFID changes the way objects are tracked on the shop floor and how manufactured goods interact with the production environment. In logistics, RFID is used to track and trace pallets or individual objects on a global scale. In retail, RFID is used to identify objects, retrieve related information, and prevent theft. Sometimes the tags remain attached to the objects post-sale, thus facilitating additional services. Overall, enterprises have much more detailed information about the objects: the use and produce, their location, their trajectories, and their physical state. In this survey paper, we show how RFID has transformed the supply chain over the past decade, discussing manufacturing, logistics, and retail and related cost/benefit considerations.

Coping with post-industrial sites is a pressing issue throughout Europe and North America. One point of departure for their general rediscovery was the revitalisation by Latz + Partner in the early 1990s of an abandoned steelworks as Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord; industrial relics were not demolished but seen as integral parts of the overall concept and imbued with new meanings and uses. Many more projects with a similar approach have since been executed and this book presents a selection of the most seminal, such as Chemetoff's Île de Nantes, Parc del Clot in Barcelona, Hargreaves/PROAP's Parque do Tejo e Tranca̋o in Lisbon and Michel Desvigne's Parc aux Angéliques in Bordeaux. Beauty Redeemed offers a systematic framework for the consideration and use of post-industrial sites. The author, Professor of Landscape Design at Copenhagen University, places these 'leftovers' in their broad historical and aesthetic context, proceeding from the 19th-century Romantic fascination with ruins through present-day industrial decline as exemplified by Detroit to a renaissance of the transformed landscape. Transformation, understood as designing with the 'as found', forms the basis of this design theory; it explores design work informed by a sensibility for redeemed beauty and various concepts of relating past, present and future.--Back cover", "title_en": "Beauty redeemed : recycling post-industrial landscapes"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4130747-1", "gnd:4513088-7", "gnd:4059261-3", "gnd:4489421-1", "gnd:4034350-9", "gnd:4186800-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1073222195", "year": "2015", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

As traces left behind by the last two hundred years of profound historical change, architecture and photography contribute both to our contemporary skyline and to our image of the past.

Architecture can be seen as a kind of macromodernity, a social scope where the diverse discourses of modernity have assumed their most large-scale form. In analogy, photographic media constitute a micromodernity, where the underside of modern society has been registered, identified, classified, and archived.

A featured review of the AMS describes the author’s earlier work in the field of approach spaces as, ‘A landmark in the history of general topology’. In this book, the author has expanded this study further and taken it in a new and exciting direction. The number of conceptually and technically different systems which characterize approach spaces is increased and moreover their uniform counterpart, uniform gauge spaces, is put into the picture. An extensive study of completions, both for approach spaces and for uniform gauge spaces, as well as compactifications for approach spaces is performed. A paradigm shift is created by the new concept of index analysis. Making use of the rich intrinsic quantitative information present in approach structures, a technique is developed whereby indices are defined that measure the extent to which properties hold, and theorems become inequalities involving indices; therefore vastly extending the realm of applicability of many classical results. The theory is then illustrated in such varied fields as topology, functional analysis, probability theory, hyperspace theory and domain theory. Finally a comprehensive analysis is made concerning the categorical aspects of the theory and its links with other topological categories.

The main objective of this book is to provide the basic concepts to enable the use of spectral and pseudospectral methods to solve problems in diverse fields of interest and to a wide audience. While spectral methods are generally based on Fourier Series or Chebychev polynomials, non-classical polynomials and associated quadratures are used for many of the applications presented in the book. Fourier series methods are summarized with a discussion of the resolution of the Gibbs phenomenon. Classical and non-classical quadratures are used for the evaluation of integrals in reaction dynamics including nuclear fusion, radial integrals in density functional theory, in elastic scattering theory and other applications. The subject matter includes the calculation of transport coefficients in gases and other gas dynamical problems based on spectral and pseudospectral solutions of the Boltzmann equation. Radiative transfer in astrophysics and atmospheric science, and applications to space physics are discussed. The relaxation of initial non-equilibrium distributions to equilibrium for several different systems is studied with the Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck equations.

This statement casually formulates a recurring motif in the history of architecture for youth: the claim to educate through the built environment. Young people were considered ideal targets for this approach of social constructivism due to their ambivalent status as objects of social rights but not yet subjects of political rights. The organisation of youth centres around leisure time activities partially concealed their educational goals and consequently made them all the more pervasive. The pedagogical power of their architecture is found not only in design but also in modes of using, appropriating and inhabiting them.

A major limitation of conventional web sites is their unorganized and isolated contents, which is created mainly for human consumption. This limitation can be addressed by organizing and publishing data, using powerful formats that add structure and meaning to the content of web pages and link related data to one another. Computers can \"understand\" such data better, which can be useful for task automation. The web sites that provide semantics (meaning) to software agents form the Semantic Web, the Artificial Intelligence extension of the World Wide Web. In contrast to the conventional Web (the \"Web of Documents\"), the Semantic Web includes the \"Web of Data\", which connects \"things\" (representing real-world humans and objects) rather than documents meaningless to computers. Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web explains the practical aspects and the theory behind the Semantic Web and how structured data, such as HTML5 Microdata and JSON-LD, can be used to improve your site’s performance on next-generation Search Engine Result Pages and be displayed on Google Knowledge Panels. You will learn how to represent arbitrary fields of human knowledge in a machine-interpretable form using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the cornerstone of the Semantic Web. You will see how to store and manipulate RDF data in purpose-built graph databases such as triplestores and quadstores, that are exploited in Internet marketing, social media, and data mining, in the form of Big Data applications such as the Google Knowledge Graph, Wikidata, or Facebook’s Social Graph. With the constantly increasing user expectations in web services and applications, Semantic Web standards gain more popularity. This book will familiarize you with the leading controlled vocabularies and ontologies and explain how to represent your own concepts. After learning the principles of Linked Data, the five-star deployment scheme, and the Open Data concept, you will be able to create and interlink five-star Linked Open Data, and merge your RDF graphs to the LOD Cloud. The book also covers the most important tools for generating, storing, extracting, and visualizing RDF data, including, but not limited to, Protégé, TopBraid Composer, Sindice, Apache Marmotta, Callimachus, and Tabulator.

After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom uses institutional analysis to explore different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons.

Anomaly! tells the story of this research, carried out by the scientists of the Collider Detector at Fermilab, and focusses specifically on the findings of several anomalous effects which were unearthed in the process.

Based on 15 months of ethnographic research in the city of Alto Hospicio in northern Chile, this book describes how the residents use social media, and the consequences of this use in their daily lives. Nell Haynes argues that social media is a place where Alto Hospicio’s residents – or Hospiceños – express their feelings of marginalisation that result from living in city far from the national capital, and with a notoriously low quality of life compared to other urban areas in Chile.In actively distancing themselves from residents in cities such as Santiago, Hospiceños identify as marginalised citizens, and express a new kind of social norm. Yet Haynes finds that by contrasting their own lived experiences with those of people in metropolitan areas, Hospiceños are strengthening their own sense of community and the sense of normativity that shapes their daily lives.

However, biodiesel and petroleum diesel differ greatly with respect to their chemical properties. Therefore, the compatibility of the materials that are commonly employed in contact with diesel must also be assured for biodiesel that has been obtained from different sources. Although nitrile rubber (NBR) has previously not been recommended for biodiesel applications, up to now no effort has been made to better understand the interaction between nitrile rubber and biodiesel or to propose improvements to the production of NBR articles. This book evaluates the resistance of different types of NBR and NBR formulations to biodiesel. It is shown how increasing acrylonitrile content and carboxylation increase the rubber resistance to biodiesel, and a new method employing accelerators to prepare novel biodiesel-resistant formulations is described. The choice of accelerator has a significant effect on the biodiesel resistance, and compositions prepared from an efficient vulcanization system are shown to be most resistant to chemical degradation. The effects on physical properties such as tensile strength, hardness, and elongation at break are also analyzed and evaluated.

In this book, Lars-Erik Janlert and Erik Stolterman investigate the elements of interaction and how they can be defined and measured. They focus on interaction with digital artifacts and systems but draw inspiration from the broader, everyday sense of the word. Viewing the topic from a design perspective, Janlert and Stolterman take as their starting point the interface, which is designed to implement the interaction. They explore how the interface has changed over time, from a surface with knobs and dials to clickable symbols to gestures to the absence of anything visible. Janlert and Stolterman examine properties and qualities of designed artifacts and systems, primarily those that are open for manipulation by designers, considering such topics as complexity, clutter, control, and the emergence of an expressive-impressive style of interaction.0They argue that only when we understand the basic concepts and terms of interactivity and interaction will we be able to discuss seriously its possible futures", "title_en": "Things that keep us busy : the elements of interaction"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4131424-4", "gnd:4038662-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1148472657; gnd:157845184", "year": "2017", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

An understanding of audio content analysis is essential for the design of intelligent music information retrieval applications and content-adaptive audio processing systems.This book is about how to teach a computer to interpret music signals, thus allowing the design of tools for interacting with music. This book serves as a comprehensive guide on audio content analysis and how to apply it in signal processing and music informatics. Written by a well-known expert in the music industry, An Introduction to Audio Content Analysis ties together topics from audio signal processing and machine learning, showing how to use audio content analysis to pick up musical characteristics automatically. The author clearly explains the analysis of audio signals and the extraction of metadata describing the content of the signal, covering both abstract descriptions of technical properties and musical descriptions such as tempo, harmony and key, musical style, and performance attributes. Musical information is given a separate analysis in each category, whether tonal, pitch, harmony, key, temporal, or tempo, among others.Readers will get access to various analysis algorithms and learn to compare different standard approaches to the same task. The book includes a review of the fundamentals of audio signal processing, psychoacoustics, and music theory.An invaluable guide for newcomers to audio signal processing and industry experts alike, An Introduction to Audio Content Analysis also features downloadable MATLAB files from a companion website, www.AudioContentAnalysis.org, lists of abbreviations and symbols, and references Machine generated contents note: 1.1.Audio Content -- 1.2.A Generalized Audio Content Analysis System -- 2.1.Audio Signals -- 2.1.1.Periodic Signals -- 2.1.2.Random Signals -- 2.1.3.Sampling and Quantization -- 2.1.4.Statistical Signal Description -- 2.2.Signal Processing -- 2.2.1.Convolution -- 2.2.2.Block-Based Processing -- 2.2.3.Fourier Transform -- 2.2.4.Constant Q Transform -- 2.2.5.Auditory Filterbanks -- 2.2.6.Correlation Function -- 2.2.7.Linear Prediction -- 3.1.Audio Pre-Processing -- 3.1.1.Down-Mixing -- 3.1.2.DC Removal -- 3.1.3.Normalization -- 3.1.4.Down-Sampling -- 3.1.5.Other Pre-Processing Options -- 3.2.Statistical Properties -- 3.2.1.Arithmetic Mean -- 3.2.2.Geometric Mean -- 3.2.3.Harmonic Mean -- 3.2.4.Generalized Mean -- 3.2.5.Centroid -- 3.2.6.Variance and Standard Deviation -- 3.2.7.Skewness -- 3.2.8.Kurtosis -- 3.2.9.Generalized Central Moments -- 3.2.10.Quantiles and Quantile Ranges -- 3.3.Spectral Shape -- 3.3.1.Spectral Rolloff -- Contents note continued: B.2.1.Delta Function -- B.2.2.Constant -- B.2.3.Cosine -- B.2.4.Rectangular Window -- B.2.5.Delta Pulse -- B.3.Transformation of Sampled Time Signals -- B.4.Short Time Fourier Transform of Continuous Signals -- B.4.1.Window Functions -- B.5.Discrete Fourier Transform -- B.5.1.Window Functions -- B.5.2.Fast Fourier Transform -- C.1.Computation of the Transformation Matrix -- C.2.Interpretation of the Transformation Matrix -- D.1.Software Frameworks and Applications -- D.1.1.Marsyas -- D.1.2.CLAM -- D.1.3.jMIR -- D.1.4.CoMIRVA -- D.1.5.Sonic Visualiser -- D.2.Software Libraries and Toolboxes -- D.2.1.Feature Extraction -- D.2.2.Plugin Interfaces -- D.2.3.Other Software Contents note continued: 3.3.2.Spectral Flux -- 3.3.3.Spectral Centroid -- 3.3.4.Spectral Spread -- 3.3.5.Spectral Decrease -- 3.3.6.Spectral Slope -- 3.3.7.Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients -- 3.4.Signal Properties -- 3.4.1.Tonalness -- 3.4.2.Autocorrelation Coefficients -- 3.4.3.Zero Crossing Rate -- 3.5.Feature Post-Processing -- 3.5.1.Derived Features -- 3.5.2.Normalization and Mapping -- 3.5.3.Subfeatures -- 3.5.4.Feature Dimensionality Reduction -- 4.1.Human Perception of Intensity and Loudness -- 4.2.Representation of Dynamics in Music -- 4.3.Features -- 4.3.1.Root Mean Square -- 4.4.Peak Envelope -- 4.5.Psycho-Acoustic Loudness Features -- 4.5.1.EBU R128 -- 5.1.Human Perception of Pitch -- 5.1.1.Pitch Scales -- 5.1.2.Chroma Perception -- 5.2.Representation of Pitch in Music -- 5.2.1.Pitch Classes and Names -- 5.2.2.Intervals -- 5.2.3.Root Note, Mode, and Key -- 5.2.4.Chords and Harmony -- 5.2.5.The Frequency of Musical Pitch -- 5.3.Fundamental Frequency Detection -- Contents note continued: 5.3.1.Detection Accuracy -- 5.3.2.Pre-Processing -- 5.3.3.Monophonic Input Signals -- 5.3.4.Polyphonic Input Signals -- 5.4.Tuning Frequency Estimation -- 5.5.Key Detection -- 5.5.1.Pitch Chroma -- 5.5.2.Key Recognition -- 5.6.Chord Recognition -- 6.1.Human Perception of Temporal Events -- 6.1.1.Onsets -- 6.1.2.Tempo and Meter -- 6.1.3.Rhythm -- 6.1.4.Timing -- 6.2.Representation of Temporal Events in Music -- 6.2.1.Tempo and Time Signature -- 6.2.2.Note Value -- 6.3.Onset Detection -- 6.3.1.Novelty Function -- 6.3.2.Peak Picking -- 6.3.3.Evaluation -- 6.4.Beat Histogram -- 6.4.1.Beat Histogram Features -- 6.5.Detection of Tempo and Beat Phase -- 6.6.Detection of Meter and Downbeat -- 7.1.Dynamic Time Warping -- 7.1.1.Example -- 7.1.2.Common Variants -- 7.1.3.Optimizations -- 7.2.Audio-to-Audio Alignment -- 7.2.1.Ground Truth Data for Evaluation -- 7.3.Audio-to-Score Alignment -- 7.3.1.Real-Time Systems M -- 7.3.2.Non-Real-Time Systems --", "title_en": "An introduction to audio content analysis : applications in signal processing and music informatics"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4054947-1", "gnd:7658708-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "IEEE Xplore (Online Service); John Wiley & Sons", "year": "2012", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}

These problems have attracted the attention of industrialists, engineers and scientists from many very diversified disciplines, such as applied mathematics, chemical, civil, environmental, mechanical and nuclear engineering, geothermal physics and food science. Thus, there is a wealth of information now available on convective processes in porous media and it is therefore appropriate and timely to undertake a new critical evaluation of this contemporary information. <IT>Transport Phenomena in Porous Media</IT> contains 17 chapters and represents the collective work of 27 of the world's leading experts, from 12 countries, in heat transfer in porous media. The recent intensive research in this area has substantially raised the expectations for numerous new practical applications and this makes the book a most timely addition to the existing literature. It includes recent major developments in both the fundamentals and applications, and provides valuable information to researchers dealing with practical problems in thermal convection in porous media. Each chapter of the book describes recent developments in the highly advanced analytical, numerical and experimental techniques which are currently being employed and discussions of possible future developments are provided.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A881224979", "content": {"text": "Transmorphic : Mapping direct manipulation to source code transformations. Defining Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) through functional abstractions can reduce the complexity that arises from mutable abstractions. Recent examples, such as Facebook's React GUI framework have shown, how modelling the view as a functional projection from the application state to a visual representation can reduce the number of interacting objects and thus help to improve the reliabiliy of the system. This however comes at the price of a more rigid, functional framework where programmers are forced to express visual entities with functional abstractions, detached from the way one intuitively thinks about the physical world. In contrast to that, the GUI Framework Morphic allows interactions in the graphical domain, such as grabbing, dragging or resizing of elements to evolve an application at runtime, providing liveness and directness in the development workflow. Modelling each visual entity through mutable abstractions however makes it difficult to ensure correctness when GUIs start to grow more complex. Furthermore, by evolving morphs at runtime through direct manipulation we diverge more and more from the symbolic description that corresponds to the morph. Given that both of these approaches have their merits and problems, is there a way to combine them in a meaningful way that preserves their respective benefits? As a solution for this problem, we propose to lift Morphic's concept of direct manipulation from the mutation of state to the transformation of source code. In particular, we will explore the design, implementation and integration of a bidirectional mapping between the graphical representation and a functional and declarative symbolic description of a graphical user interface within a self hosted development environment. We will present Transmorphic, a functional take on the Morphic GUI Framework, where the visual and structural properties of morphs are defined in a purely functional, declarative fashion. In Transmorphic, the developer is able to assemble different morphs at runtime through direct manipulation which is automatically translated into changes in the code of the application. In this way, the comprehensiveness and predictability of direct manipulation can be used in the context of a purely functional GUI, while the effects of the manipulation are reflected in a medium that is always in reach for the programmer and can even be used to incorporate the source transformations into the source files of the application.", "title_en": "Transmorphic : Mapping direct manipulation to source code transformations"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4198740-8", "gnd:4275084-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Schreiber, Robin; Krahn, Robert; Ingalls, Daniel H.

Impact mechanics is concerned with the reaction forces that develop during a collision and the dynamic response of structures to these reaction forces. The subject has a wide range of engineering applications, from designing sports equipment to improving the crashworthiness of automobiles. This book develops several different methodologies for analysing collisions between structures. These range from rigid body theory for structures that are stiff and compact, to vibration and wave analyses for flexible structures. The emphasis is on low-speed impact where damage is local to the small region of contact between the colliding bodies. The analytical methods presented give results that are more robust or less sensitive to initial conditions than have been achieved hitherto. As a text, Impact Mechanics builds upon foundation courses in dynamics and strength of materials.

Much has been written on the role of causal notions and causal reasoning in the so-called 'special sciences' and in common sense. But does causal reasoning also play a role in physics? Mathias Frisch argues that, contrary to what influential philosophical arguments purport to show, the answer is yes. Time-asymmetric causal structures are as integral a part of the representational toolkit of physics as a theory's dynamical equations. Frisch develops his argument partly through a critique of anti-causal arguments and partly through a detailed examination of actual examples of causal notions in physics, including causal principles invoked in linear response theory and in representations of radiation phenomena.

Architecture, we like to believe, is an elevated art form that shapes the world as it pleases. Four Walls and a Roof challenges this notion, presenting a candid account of what it is really like to work as an architect, buffeted by external forces that make a mockery of any pretense to visionary authority. Reinier de Graaf draws on his own tragicomic experiences in the field to reveal the world of contemporary architecture in vivid snapshots. He takes us from suburban New York to the rubble of northern Iraq, from the corridors of wealth in London, Moscow, and Dubai to garbage-strewn wastelands that represent the demolished hopes of postwar social housing. We meet oligarchs determined to translate ambitions into concrete and steel, developers for whom architecture is mere investment, and the layers of politicians, bureaucrats, consultants, and mysterious hangers-on who lie between any architectural idea and the chance of its execution. He introduces us to histories of modern architecture that determine--at least as much as individual inspiration--what architects design. And he questions the hubris of those who believe they are the solution to the overwhelming problems of booming megacities. Perhaps the most important myth de Graaf debunks is success itself. To achieve anything, architects must serve the powers they strive to critique, finding themselves in a perpetual conflict of interest.

Its unique provenance ? the fact that it is \"mined\" from the very fabric of the human body? makes it a mercurial resource; one that no one seemingly owns, but in which many have deeply vested interests. Who has the right to exploit and benefit from bioinformation? The individual or community from whom it was derived? The scientists and technicians who make its extraction both possible and meaningful or the commercial and political interests which fund this work? Who is excluded or even at risk from its commercialisation? And what threats and opportunities might the generation of ? Big Bioinformational Data? raise? In this groundbreaking book, authors Bronwyn Parry and Beth Greenhough explore the complex economic, social and political questions arising from the creation and use of bioinformation. Drawing on a range of highly topical cases, including the commercialization of human sequence data; the forensic use of retained bioinformation; biobanking and genealogical research, they show how demand for this resource has grown significantly driving a burgeoning but often highly controversial global economy in bioinformation.

Advances in battery and other technologies, new federal standards for carbon-dioxide emissions and fuel economy, state zero-emission-vehicle requirements, and the current administration's goal of putting millions of alternative-fuel vehicles on the road have all highlighted PEVs as a transportation alternative. Consumers are also beginning to recognize the advantages of PEVs over conventional vehicles, such as lower operating costs, smoother operation, and better acceleration; the ability to fuel up at home; and zero tailpipe emissions when the vehicle operates solely on its battery. There are, however, barriers to PEV deployment, including the vehicle cost, the short all-electric driving range, the long battery charging time, uncertainties about battery life, the few choices of vehicle models, and the need for a charging infrastructure to support PEVs. What should industry do to improve the performance of PEVs and make them more attractive to consumers? At the request of Congress, Overcoming Barriers to Deployment of Plug-in Electric Vehicles identifies barriers to the introduction of electric vehicles and recommends ways to mitigate these barriers. This report examines the characteristics and capabilities of electric vehicle technologies, such as cost, performance, range, safety, and durability, and assesses how these factors might create barriers to widespread deployment. Overcoming Barriers to Deployment of Plug-in Electric Vehicles provides an overview of the current status of PEVs and makes recommendations to spur the industry and increase the attractiveness of this promising technology for consumers.

Therefore, lecturers are faced with the urgent task of not only providing students with information about the subject, but also to help them master the material at a deep qualitative level, by presenting the specific features of general approaches to the statement and the solution of problems in theoretical physics. One of the ways to study field theory is the practical one, where the students can deepen their knowledge of the theoretical material and develop problem-solving skills. This book includes a concise theoretical summary of the main branches of field theory and electrodynamics, worked examples, and some problems for the student to solve. The book is written for students of theoretical and applied physics, and corresponds to the curricula of the theoretical courses \"Field theory\" and \"Electrodynamics\" for physics undergraduates. It can also be useful for students of other disciplines, in particular, those in which physics is one of the base subjects\"-- Vector and tensor analyses -- Elements of the special theory of relativity -- Relativistic mechanics -- Constant electric and magnetic fields in vacuum -- Electromagnetic waves -- Field of moving charges -- Emission of electromagnetic waves", "title_en": "Problems and solutions in special relativity and electromagnetism"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4182215-8", "gnd:4014306-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:143176633", "year": "2018", "type": "Book", "language_original": "en"}}
