Permafrost landscapes in the Northern high latitudes with their massive organic carbon stocks are critically important for the global carbon cycle. Large uncertainties in the sustainability of these carbon pools under future climate conditions persist, caused by limited understanding of permafrost carbon cycling processes. A continuous observation program was established near the city of Chersky, NE Siberia, representing a wet tussock tundra ecosystem. Year-round eddy-covariance measurements focused on ecosystem–atmosphere exchange fluxes of carbon. Recent observations started mid-July 2013, while historic measurements are available for the period 2002–2005. Since 2004 part of the observation area has been disturbed by a circular drainage ditch, altering the soil water conditions in a way that is expected for degrading of ice-rich permafrost under a warming climate. In comparison to the strong reduction of fluxes immediately following the drainage disturbance in 2005, recent CO2 exchange with the atmosphere over this disturbed part of the tundra indicate a higher carbon turnover, and a seasonal amplitude that is comparable again to that within the control section. By comparing CO2 budgets from the drained and control ecosystems a systematically reduced sink strength within the drained area is found, dominated by increased respiration due to warmer near-surface soil layers. Reduced CH4 emissions are observed under drier and more aerobic conditions resulting in half the efflux from the drained ecosystem in comparison to the control ecosystem. As a net effect of the drainage an increased source of CO2, eq. to the atmosphere indicates a positive effect on global warming.

Within gauge/gravity duality, we study the class of four dimensional CFTs with chiral anomaly described by Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in five dimensions. In the first part of this thesis we compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the metric and gauge field perturbations about electrically and magnetically charged black branes. By the gauge/gravity correspondence, this theory is dual to a particular class of field theories with a chiral anomaly, in a thermal charged plasma state subjected to a constant external magnetic field B. The QNMs are dual to the poles of the two-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor and axial current operators, and they encode information about the dissipation and transport of charges in the plasma. Complementary to the gravity calculation, we work out the hydrodynamic description of the dual field theory in the presence of a chiral anomaly, and a constant external B. We find QNMs exhibiting Landau level behavior, which become long-lived at large B if the anomaly coefficient exceeds a critical magnitude. Chiral transport is analyzed beyond the hydrodynamic approximation for the five (formerly) hydrodynamic modes, including a chiral magnetic wave. In the second part we consider the phase diagram at finite temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field B. At high temperatures the solution is given by the electrically and magnetically charged AdS Reissner-Nordstroem black brane, studied in first part of this thesis.

Abstract: Visual localization of autonomous vehicles is imperative to their safe navigation in particular scenarios. The paradigm of monocular camera localization encompasses broad range of applications like place recognition, loop closure detections within a SLAM framework, 6-DoF metric camera pose estimation and augmented reality. To achieve accurate and reliable pose estimates, camera-based localization approaches need to cope with wide variety of challenging perceptual conditions. These methods should be robust to variation in illumination due to day-night changes, different weather conditions and seasonal variations. An autonomous robot should be able to cope with all such variations that enables it to operate over long periods of time.<br>In this thesis, we primarily focus on novel robust methods for long term camera-based visual localization that cope with wide variety of viewing conditions. We highlight the shortcomings of state-of-the-art feature-based methods for monocular cameras and present novel approaches to achieve reliable localization. Although, cameras provide an cost effective solution for autonomous navigation, image data is highly vulnerable to environmental conditions. The rich texture and color information in the images vary drastically over long periods of time. In this work, we develop distinctive and repeatable feature descriptions of images that allow robots to localize under a great spectrum of perceptual conditions. We also develop novel methods that leverage semantics of the environment to imitate human-like behavior in autonomous systems during localization. These methods also scale well with the large map sizes. <br>At first, we discuss both the advantages and shortcomings of the visual information from the cameras for longterm localization. We identify the drawbacks of traditional sparse feature-based methods for longterm localization and propose dense feature descriptions to cope with the pitfalls. We show that by leveraging the sequential nature of the recorded and live data stream from the robot within a network flow graph framework enables to remove false loop closure hypothesis and achieve more precise location estimates. This enables the robot to achieve robust topological localization in a place recognition framework.

Abstract: Vast reserves of anthracite coal have been detected in the Quang Ninh province in the northeastern region of Vietnam (reserves~6.3 Gt). Cam Pha, located in the Quang Ninh province, is one of the largest anthracite coal mining areas. Coal mining activities are a source of atmospheric pollution and are also detrimental to water quality. These factors are a hazard to human health. <br>This study is aimed at characterizing the forms of environmental pollution derived from coal mining activities and mine waste. Mining leads to environmental damage through airborne dust, acid mine drainage and chemical weathering of waste rock. One aim of this study was to identify the source of airborne dust in this area and its chemical and physical properties were characterized, as well as its effects on human health, focusing on identifying the source of the coal miners’ occupational diseases. A second aim was to determine the effects of acid mine drainage on water quality near the largest coal mine in the area. In order to achieve these goals, field samples including: airborne particles, coal and waste rock, material in overburden piles, mine tailings, dumps, water samples and the lung lavage samples were collected. The mineral composition of solid samples was determined by using a variety of complementary microscopic and bulk analysis techniques (e.g. EMPA, XRD, SEM/EDS, F-AAS, GF-AAS, ICP-MS). The results showed that dust, lung lavages and waste rock were composed of the same mineral components, such as: quartz, kaolinite, illite and muscovite. Furthermore, the bulk chemical composition of airborne particles were investigated which were then compared to the composition of other solid samples (e.g. waste rock, coal). To establish a link between airborne dust particles and these materials, it is of utmost importance to understand the geological features of coal mining area.

In today’s multi-disciplinary and collaborative research environments, data is often produced and consumed by various means, multiple researchers operate on the data in different divisions to satisfy various research requirements, and using different query processors and analysis tools. This makes data integration a crucial component of any successful data intensive research activity. The fundamental difficulty is that data is heterogeneous not only in syntax, structure, and semantics, but also in the way it is accessed and queried. We introduce QUIS (QUery In-Situ), an agile query system equipped with a unified query language and a federated execution engine. It is capable of running queries on heterogeneous data sources in an in-situ manner. Its language provides advanced features such as virtual schemas, heterogeneous joins, and polymorphic result set representation. QUIS utilizes a federation of agents to transform a given input query written in its language to a (set of) computation models that are executable on the designated data sources. Federative query virtualization has the disadvantage that some aspects of a query may not be supported by the designated data sources. QUIS ensures that input queries are always fully satisfied. Therefore, if the target data sources do not fulfill all of the query requirements, QUIS detects the features that are lacking and complements them in a transparent manner. QUIS provides union and join capabilities over an unbound list of heterogeneous data sources; in addition, it offers solutions for heterogeneous query planning and optimization. In brief, QUIS is intended to mitigate data access heterogeneity through query virtualization, on-the-fly transformation, and federated execution. It offers in-Situ querying, agile querying, heterogeneous data source querying, unifeied execution, late-bound virtual schemas, and Remote execution.", "title_en": "Querying heterogeneous data in an in-situ unified agile system"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4011149-0", "gnd:4197730-0", "gnd:4201275-2", "gnd:4378490-2", "gnd:4148871-4", "gnd:1168760348"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1158528841; gnd:36164-1", "year": "2018", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Azobenzene-based molecular photoswitches have extensively been applied to biological systems, involving photo-control of peptides, lipids and nucleic acids. The isomerization between the stable trans and the metastable cis state of the azo moieties leads to pronounced changes in shape and other physico-chemical properties of the molecules into which they are incorporated. Fast switching can be induced via transitions to excited electronic states and fine-tuned by a large number of different substituents at the phenyl rings.

The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is a complex of at least 15 genetically different host races that are native to specific legume plants but can all develop on the universal host plant Vicia faba. Despite much research, it is still unclear why pea aphid host races can accept and colonize their native host plants while non-native host races are not. To determine the changes in the host plant chemistry and their possible influence in the specificity of the pea aphid host races, we used several metabolomics aproaches on full factorial experimental set ups by infesting separately four different plant species (Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense, Pisum sativum, and Vicia faba) with native and non-native pea aphid clones of various host races. Our results from the non-targeted and targeted approaches suggested that the plant species investigated have developed different complexities of chemicals to defend themselves from the attack of herbivores including phloem feeders. Our results also suggested that A. pisum clones have evolved different feeding strategies to manipulate the host plant defense signaling, reduced deterrence or toxicity, improved host quality, reduction of enemies, and improved quality of future food sources in the vicinity to perform better on these plants. We have selected a group of polar and non-polar secondary metabolites that might be associated with the discrimination and compatibility of the pea aphid host races with the different legume species used in this project.

It is based on the finding that innate restriction factors represent effective species barriers that need to be overcome by viruses trying to invade a human host. In mice, innate immune control of influenza viruses is mediated by the interferon-regulated Mx1 gene. The MX1 orthologue of humans (encoding MxA protein) provides broad resistance to influenza and other viruses in cell culture systems. MxA is targeting the nucleoprotein of influenza A viruses which encapsidates the viral genome and is pivotal to virus replication. Influenza A viruses that successfully established stable lineages in humans acquired adaptive mutations in the nucleoprotein that allow partial MxA escape in cell culture experiments. Our new mouse strain lacks functional endogenous Mx genes but instead carries the human MX1 locus as transgene. Our transgenic mice were largely resistant to highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 influenza A viruses, but were almost as susceptible to infection with influenza viruses of human origin as non-transgenic littermates. We further demonstrate that an engineered avian H7N7 influenza virus carrying a nucleoprotein with signature mutations typically found in human virus isolates was more virulent in transgenic mice than the parental virus. These findings illustrate that a few amino acid changes in the viral nucleoprotein can mediate escape from MxA restriction in vivo.

Abstract: Introduction: Progression through the cell cycle is tightly regulated by different cyclin-dependent kinases and their activating cyclin subunits. Stage-specific proteolysis of cyclins and other cell cycle regulators is important for transition to the next cell cycle phase. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that controls mitosis and G1 through degradation of these proteins. Through its activating subunits Cdh1 and Cdc20 the APC/C assures substrate-specifity. While Cdc20 regulates progression through mitosis, Cdh1 is activated in late mitosis to coordinate accurate entry into S-phase. Thereby, the APC/C is crucial for maintaining genomic stability during the cell cycle.<br>Results: Characterization of a Cdh1-kd revealed strong stabilization of the substrates cyclin A/B leading to diminished loading of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins on replication origins in G1. Stabilization of cyclin A/B may cause the observed premature entry into S-phase, while the reduced loading of MCMs in G1 could be responsible for the prolonged replication in S-phase seen in Cdh1-kd cells. Plk1 was stabilized in Cdh1-kd cells, which may cause bypass of the Cdh1-Plk1 dependent DNA damage checkpoint. Indeed, potential replication stress in Cdh1-kd cells did not lead to G2/M arrest, but was enforced by inhibition of the Cdh1 substrate Plk1. Underreplicated DNA and replication intermediates in mitosis may be the reason for increased genomic instability, namely lagging chromosomes, anaphase bridges and micronuclei in Cdh1-kd cells detected by live-cell imaging. Monitoring of 53BP1, a DNA-repair marker, in living cells could also prove amplified DNA-damage through increased double-strand breaks in Cdh1-kd cells. In addition, aberrant cytokinesis and the development of tetraploid cells generated by misseparation of chromosomes during mitosis were enhanced in Cdh1-kd cells.<br>Conclusions: Downregulation of the tumor suppressor APC/C-Cdh1 leads to deregulation of DNA-replication by stabilizing cyclin A and B in G1 and reduced loading of replication origins with MCM proteins resulting in enhanced genomic instability", "title_en": "Der Tumorsuppressor APC/CCdh1 und seine Rolle bei der Entstehung von Replikationsstress und genetischer Instabilität"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:7534837-8", "gnd:4326903-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1163284564", "year": "2018", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

Although glasses are commonly thought of as ideal brittle materials, a local plastic deformation can be induced by the penetration of sharp objects, such as the indenter tips commonly employed for hardness testing. Since the first experimental verification of this phenomenon, considerable research effort has been devoted to the underlying microscopic mechanisms, which govern the indentation deformation of glasses, but also to associated properties of technological relevance, like crack initiation and defect tolerance, fracture toughness, brittleness or even scratchability. In early indentation studies, this has been achieved through a post-mortem topographic or spectroscopic analysis of the residual hardness imprints left on the glass surface. However, with the ongoing demand for a mechanical characterization at small-scales, advanced indentation protocols have been developed, which nowadays allow for a more comprehensive description of the fundamental deformation processes in amorphous materials and by extension, the design of more defect-tolerant glasses. But regardless of the numerous studies on the contact damage resistance of glasses, the time or rate dependence of the indentation deformation, commonly referred to as creep, still remains poorly understood. To overcome this issue, the influence of the imposed strain-rate on the hardness of a variety of glasses with covalent, ionic and metallic bonding character as well as varying degrees of network dimensionality and atomic packing density was characterized in a nanoindentation strain-rate jump test.

This book addresses problems in three main developments in modern condensed matter physics- namely topological superconductivity, many-body localization and strongly interacting condensates/superfluids-by employing fruitful analogies from classical mechanics. This strategy has led to tangible results, firstly in superconducting nanowires: the density of states, a smoking gun for the long sought Majorana zero mode is calculated effortlessly by mapping the problem to a textbook-level classical point particle problem. Secondly, in localization theory even the simplest toy models that exhibit many-body localization are mathematically cumbersome and results rely on simulations that are limited by computational power. In this book an alternative viewpoint is developed by describing many-body localization in terms of quantum rotors that have incommensurate rotation frequencies, an exactly solvable system. Finally, the fluctuations in a strongly interacting Bose condensate and superfluid, a notoriously difficult system to analyze from first principles, are shown to mimic stochastic fluctuations of space-time due to quantum fields. This analogy not only allows for the computation of physical properties of the fluctuations in an elegant way, it sheds light on the nature of space-time.

In this thesis, I overcome the challenges and fill the gaps in knowledge for the design and analysis of photonic crystal slab waveguides (PCSWs) as spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources of photon-pairs, as well as to investigate their potential for engineering the properties of the photon-pair quantum state. I have developed the required formalism for analyzing both the quantum process of SPDC and its classical counterpart of second-harmonic generation (SHG). In studying SHG, I verified my formalism through comparing its results with direct nonlinear simulations. In these formulations, special attention was given to treating lossy modes, as they prove to be an inherent part of the SPDC designs in PCSWs. Moreover, I have found a practical set of PCSW designs, phase-matched for three-wave-mixing processes, while demonstrating that PCSWs can offer a strong control over the phase-matching configuration. This includes reaching phase-matching between modes of different propagation directions, reaching simultaneous phase-matching between multiple processes, and controlling the group velocity of the modes at the point of phase-matching. These capabilities proved to be the key to discovering the unique strength of PCSWs for the SPDC application. Through the use of various phase-matching configurations, I showed how compact SPDC sources can be designed using PCSWs that are capable of creating entanglement and tuning its extent in different degrees of freedom, with specific examples for path and spectral degrees of entanglement, all in a fully integrated way and directly at the generation step. This work also includes my experimental results on characterizing lithium niobate nanostructured ridge waveguides, demonstrating phase-matched SHG.

This Work presents a detailed experimental study on carbon fibre (CF) polyether etherketone (PEEK) composites fasteners designed to join conventional high performance composites (CFRP). The failure mechanisms of two CF-PEEK fasteners with countersunk heads joining two laminate plates in a single-lap configuration were investigated under static (tensile) and cyclic loading (tension-tension).

This dissertation focuses on the investigation and development of an optical biosensor based on fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) that provides chemical selective and sensitive label-free detection of biomolecules. FERS has been achieved by using various types of liquid core optical fibers, which guide the light within the liquid sample and increase the interaction length with the analyte molecules. The first part of this dissertation explains the FERS technique in detail and describes the current state of research of FERS. Several essential characteristics, such as fiber length, attenuation, material and refractive index, are thoroughly discussed in considerations of Raman intensity enhancement. Liquid-core fibers formed with hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers (HC-PCFs) and polymer fibers are introduced and discussed, as they are the most important breakthroughs. The objective of this research is to develop a robust optical fiber platform based on Raman spectroscopy that shows potential for use in bio-analytical and clinical applications. In this work, I demonstrate a combination of UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy (UV-RRS) and liquid-core fibers, to increases the sensitivity for the detection of low-concentrated pharmaceuticals tremendously. This combined enhancement technique was applied for the detection of bile pigments for monitoring of diseases related to hyperbilirubinemia and hyperbiliverdinemia. Their poor optical quality strongly limits the performances of the polymer-based liquid-core fibers. Therefore, the implementation of HC-PCFs was explored in two different types of optical guiding. Waveguiding in the visible range is achieved for the first time in both kinds of liquid-filled HC-PCFs, and therefore the Raman scattering wavelengths are not anymore limited to the insensitive NIR range. In order to achieve easy-to-use and stable FERS devices for further development, the performance of HC-PCFs in the aspect of light-confinement was studied with the help of a specially designed multi-channel Raman chemical imaging. The optimal fiber length, spatial filtering, and optical coupling were thoroughly analyzed, and an automatic coupling system was developed.

In this thesis, the author describes the development of a software framework to systematically construct a particular class of weakly coupled free fermionic heterotic string models, dubbed gauge models. In their purest form, these models are maximally supersymmetric (N = 4), and thus only contain superpartners in their matter sector. This feature makes their systematic construction particularly efficient, and they are thus useful in their simplicity. The thesis first provides a brisk introduction to heterotic strings and the spin-structure construction of free fermionic models. Three systematic surveys are then presented, and it is conjectured that these surveys are exhaustive modulo redundancies. Finally, the author presents a collection of metaheuristic algorithms for searching the landscape for models with a user-specified spectrum of phenomenological properties, e.g. gauge group and number of spacetime supersymmetries. Such algorithms provide the groundwork for extended generic free fermionic surveys.

The use of TPQ formulation has practical advantages in its application to numerical computations and allows for significant reduction in computation cost in numerics.

This book focuses on the microscopic understanding of the function of organic semiconductors. By tracing the link between their morphological structure and electronic properties across multiple scales, it represents an important advance in this direction. Organic semiconductors are materials at the interface between hard and soft matter: they combine structural variability, processibility and mechanical flexibility with the ability to efficiently transport charge and energy. This unique set of properties makes them a promising class of materials for electronic devices, including organic solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Understanding their function at the microscopic scale – the goal of this work – is a prerequisite for the rational design and optimization of the underlying materials. Based on new multiscale simulation protocols, the book studies the complex interplay between molecular architecture, supramolecular organization and electronic structure in order to reveal why some materials perform well – and why others do not.

In this thesis, the ionization of atoms and small molecules in strong laser fields is experimentally studied using a reaction microscope. The population of autoionizing doubly excited states in the laser fields is proven and a possible connection to the well-known dielectronic recombination processes is discussed. The fundamental process of tunnel ionization in strong laser fields is subject of investigation in a pump-probe experiment with ultrashort laser pulses. A coherent superposition of electronic states in singly charged argon ions is created within the first, and subsequently tunnel-ionized with the second pulse. This gives access to state-selective information about the tunneling process and allows to test common models. Moreover, the ionization of krypton and argon at different wavelengths is studied, from the multiphoton to the tunneling regime. The wavelength-dependent investigations are furthermore extended to molecular hydrogen. In addition to ionization, this system might undergo different dissociative processes. Channel-selective electron momentum distributions are presented and compared to each other.

This thesis develops two exciting areas of particle physics research. It applies the recent new insights about the usefulness of helicity amplitudes in understanding gauge theory to the long-standing effort to understand theories with both electric and magnetic charges. It is known that for some supersymmetric theories there is an exact duality that relates two descriptions of the physics, one where the electric charges are weakly coupled and another where the electric charges are strongly coupled. The calculations in this thesis suggest that this duality can also hold in the low-energy limit of nonsupersymmetric gauge theories. The idea of addressing the hierarchy problem of the standard model Higgs mechanism using conformal symmetry is also explored.

This thesis represents the first double differential measurement of quasi-elastic anti-neutrino scattering in the few GeV range--a region of substantial theoretical and experimental interest as it is the kinematic region where studies of charge-parity (CP) violation in the neutrino sector most require precise understanding of the differences between anti-neutrino and neutrino scatter. This dissertation also presents total antineutrino-scintillator quasi-elastic cross sections as a function of energy, which is then compared to measurements from previous experiments. Next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments, such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande, hope to measure CP violation in the lepton sector. In order to do this, they must dramatically reduce their current levels of uncertainty, particularly those due to neutrino-nucleus interaction models. As CP violation is a measure of the difference between the oscillation properties of neutrinos and antineutrinos, data about how the less-studied antineutrinos interact is especially valuable. The measurement described herewith determines the nuclear and instrumental effects that must be understood to undertake precision neutrino physics. As well as being useful to help reduce oscillation experiments' uncertainty, this data can also be used to study the prevalence of various correlation and final-state interaction effects within the nucleus.

It explores the observational consequences of the second-order vector mode, and addresses magnetic field generation and the weak lensing signatures, which are key phenomena of the vector mode. The author demonstrates that the second-order vector mode, which never appears at the linear-order level, naturally arises from the non-linear coupling of the first-order scalar modes. This leads to the remarkable statement that the vector-order mode clearly contributes to the generation of cosmological magnetic fields.

This thesis presents an experimental study of ordering phenomena in rare-earth nickelate-based heterostructures by means of inelastic Raman light scattering and elastic resonant x-ray scattering (RXS).

The two key outcomes of the thesis are: (a) demonstratingfull control over the charge/bond and spin order parameters in specifically designed praseodymium nickelate heterostructures and observation of a novel spin density wave phase in absence of the charge/bond order parameter, which confirms theoretical predictions of a spin density wave phase driven by spatial confinement of the conduction electrons; and (b) assessing the thickness-induced crossover between collinear and non-collinear spin structures in neodymium nickelate slabs, which is correctly predicted by drawing on density functional theory. .

International peace missions face a fundamental dilemma between their aims of ending conflict and also fostering good governance. This study presents empirical evidence that more is not better in international peacekeeping: more authority vested in a peace mission yields less effectiveness in curbing corruption. Its author applies a framework that uses the intrusiveness of international peace missions to study their effects on corruption. Bridging the gap between large-N quantitative studies and single case studies, the study pursues a mixed methods design, employing statistical analyses as well as qualitative case studies of Sierra Leone, Côte D’Ivoire, Kosovo and Croatia. The analysis shows that highly intrusive peace missions are more likely to enable corruption than to constrain it. By contrast, missions with medium levels of intrusiveness are more likely to contribute to better control of corruption by acting as impartial arbitrators and by conditioning external assistance. Internationale Friedensmissionen navigieren einen fundamentalen Zielkonflikt: einerseits gewaltsame Konflikte befrieden und gleichzeitig gute Regierungsführung fördern zu müssen.

A reliable inference of networks from data is of key interest in many scientific fields. Several methods have been suggested in the literature to reliably determine links in a network.

In this thesis new methodologies to improve network inference are suggested. Initial analyses demonstrate the impact of falsepositive and false negative conclusions about the presence or absence of links on the resulting inferred network. Consequently, revealing the importance of making well-considered choices leads to suggest new approaches to enhance existing network reconstruction methods.

Partial melting is a first order process for the chemical differentiation of the crust (Vielzeuf et al., 1990).

Understanding of the diverse processes and their controlling factors is therefore not only of scientific interest but also of high economic importance to cover the demand for rare metals. The redistribution of major and trace elements during partial melting represents a central step for the understanding how granite-bound mineralization develops (Hedenquist and Lowenstern, 1994).

Organic semiconductors are a promising class of materials. Their special properties are the particularly good absorption, low weight and easy processing into thin films. Therefore, intense research has been devoted to the realization of thin film organic solar cells (OPVs). Because of the low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors, primary excitations (excitons) are strongly bound and a type II heterojunction needs to be introduced to split these excitations into free charges. Therefore, most organic solar cells consist of at least an electron donor and electron acceptor material. For such donor acceptor systems mainly three states are relevant; the photoexcited exciton on the donor or acceptor material, the charge transfer state at the donor-acceptor interface and the charge separated state of a free electron and hole. The interplay between these states significantly determines the efficiency of organic solar cells.

Polymeric nanomaterials, which represent a material class of tremendous interest for drug delivery, are in focus of this present thesis. In order to study their mode-of-action and deduce comprehensive concepts of particle-cell interactions, high-performance imaging techniques represent a particularly valuable investigation platform, since they provide a direct insight into cellular uptake mechanisms as well as their intracellular distribution. For this reason, the present thesis pursues the implementation of two suitable imaging techniques providing information on a high-resolution level, i.e. fluorescence microscopy (FM) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In this context, the utilization of carefully selected labeling strategies renders FM a powerful technique, which enables the unambiguous identification of the particles within their intracellular environment with an appropriate image contrast. Nonetheless, this method suffers from a poor resolution, so that individual particles cannot be sufficiently visualized. TEM, on the contrary, exhibits a resolution far beyond the particle size; however, polymeric nanomaterials do not show an appropriate image contrast alongside the cellular interior, which is a direct result of their similar electron contrasts.

This thesis provides the first comprehensive theoretical overview of the electronic and optical properties of two dimensional (2D) Indium Selenide: atomically thin films of InSe ranging from monolayers to few layers in thickness. The thesis shows how the electronic propertes of 2D InSe vary significantly with film thickness, changing from a weakly indirect semiconductor for the monolayer to a direct gap material in the bulk form, with a strong band gap variation with film thickness predicted and recently observed in optical experiments.

The signal process is the pair production of VLT decaying into a Higgs boson and top quark (TT→Ht+X, X=Ht, Wb, Zt).

In order to better differentiate between signals and backgrounds, exclusive taggers of top quark and Higgs boson were developed and optimised for VLT signals. These efforts improved the sensitivity by roughly 30%, compared to the previous analysis. The analysis outcomes yield the strongest constraints on parameter space in various BSM theoretical models.

The present study focuses on technological developments in the history of glass technology. I selected four aspects of glass manufacture from different periods, beginning in the earliest period of artificial glass and ending in the Early Modern time. The technology of glass manufacture was investigated by analysis of archaeological glass samples and the reproduction of used materials. The experimental approach enabled a detailed understanding of the challenges and specifications during the manufacture. In a first study, the formation of potential borosilicate layers on Mycenaean LBA relief fragments, that have been found close to gold sheet, were studied. We could demonstrate by infrared reflection spectroscopy that both borate contamination on gold and borax powder interact with the glass surface at temperatures above 800 ◦C. I suggested three mechanisms for potential borate contamination, that is by alteration of the gold sheet, the glass surface or the usage borax as a solder. The second study analyses the opacification process of Roman mosaic tesserae by the calcium antimonates CaSb2O6 and Ca2Sb2O7, and demonstrates that the in-situ crystallization at temperatures below 1200 ◦C produces the most reliable opacification. We reproduced the process in an experimental archaeological glass furnace at temperatures around 1050 ◦C. In a third study, I analyzed a selection of a Medieval glass feature from Münster, Germany, by X-ray fluorescence and optical spectroscopy. I demonstrate that the glass samples were made by at least three recipes. The fourth study focuses on the scattering properties of Cu2O and Cu0 particles with different sizes. I show by simulation of the Mie backscattering and absorption cross sections, how the optical spectra change depending on the particle size and the wavelength of light. Comparison with two late medieval / early modern sample sets from Glashütten, Germany and Wieda, Germany and fitting the backscattering curves into the UV/Vis/NIR reflectance spectra yielded an average Cu0 particle radius of 60 nm to 95 nm.

This thesis addresses an adaptive higher-order method based on a Geometry Independent Field approximatTion(GIFT) of polynomial/rationals plines over hierarchical T-meshes(PHT/RHT-splines). In isogeometric analysis, basis functions used for constructing geometric models in computer-aided design(CAD) are also employed to discretize the partial differential equations(PDEs) for numerical analysis. Non-uniform rational B-Splines(NURBS) are the most commonly used basis functions in CAD. However, they may not be ideal for numerical analysis where local refinement is required. The alternative method GIFT deploys different splines for geometry and numerical analysis. NURBS are utilized for the geometry representation, while for the field solution, PHT/RHT-splines are used. PHT-splines not only inherit the useful properties of B-splines and NURBS, but also possess the capabilities of local refinement and hierarchical structure. The smooth basis function properties of PHT-splines make them suitable for analysis purposes. While most problems considered in isogeometric analysis can be solved efficiently when the solution is smooth, many non-trivial problems have rough solutions. For example, this can be caused by the presence of re-entrant corners in the domain. For such problems, a tensor-product basis (as in the case of NURBS) is less suitable for resolving the singularities that appear since refinement propagates throughout the computational domain. Hierarchical bases and local refinement (as in the case of PHT-splines) allow for a more efficient way to resolve these singularities by adding more degrees of freedom where they are necessary. In order to drive the adaptive refinement, an efficient recovery-based error estimator is proposed in this thesis. The estimator produces a recovery solution which is a more accurate approximation than the computed numerical solution. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical investigations with PHT-splines of higher order and continuity prove that the proposed method is capable of obtaining results with higher accuracy, better convergence, fewer degrees of freedom and less computational cost than NURBS for smooth solution problems. The adaptive GIFT method utilizing PHT-splines with the recovery-based error estimator is used for solutions with discontinuities or singularities where adaptive local refinement in particular domains of interest achieves higher accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom. This method also proves that it can handle complicated multi-patch domains for two- and three-dimensional problems outperforming uniform refinement in terms of degrees of freedom and computational cost.", "title_en": "Isogeometric analysis based on Geometry Independent Field approximaTion (GIFT) and Polynomial Splines over Hierarchical T-meshes"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:7718401-4", "gnd:4017233-8", "gnd:4376916-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5180842-0; gnd:1201298210", "year": "2018", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Against this background, this volume investigates if Germany should take similar political measures and considers the construction of a new service infrastructure of charging stations that would be required by electric vehicles.As a result, the economic analysis shows that network effects hinder the market entry of new drivetrain technologies and thus provide an argument for political actions.

Abstract: This thesis consists of three parts each dealing with different questions related to population genetics. We start with the study of the effect of natural selection on genealogies. We make use of the theory on tree-valued Fleming-Viot processes that describe the evolution of genealogical trees to compute the Laplace-transform of the tree length both in the neutral and in the selective setting. We show that trees are shorter in the selective case (under the so-called Laplace-transform-order) than trees under neutrality - an assumption already widely believed to be true in the field of biology.<br>In the second part we work with a mutation-selection model in a fluctuating environment by introducing a modifier locus determining the mutation rate at a second locus. Fitness acts on the second locus and changes as the environment fluctuates. For a fast fluctutating environment, we obtain limit results for the evolution of allele frequencies and apply them to a two-type setting in which we compute the fixation probability for the higher mutation rate.<br>The last part focuses on analysing human DNA samples and estimating their heritage. The aim is to extend the already existing models for inferring individual admixture proportions - a vector of which each entry corresponds to the fraction of one's genome originating from a certain population.

Uzi Leibner aims to provide the most accurate picture possible of the nature and history of the rural settlement in the Lower Galilee during Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods when this region played an important role in the development of both Judaism and Christianity. In an attempt to draw a historical reconstruction based on systematic data, a test case area in the »heart« of ancient Galilee was chosen for this research. Uzi Leibner used two distinct disciplines: the study of the relevant historical sources and the advanced archaeological field survey.

Material properties play a critical role in durable products manufacturing. Estimation of the precise characteristics in different scales requires complex and expensive experimental measurements. Potentially, computational methods can provide a platform to determine the fundamental properties before the final experiment. Multi-scale computational modeling leads to the modeling of the various time, and length scales include nano, micro, meso, and macro scales. These scales can be modeled separately or in correlation with coarser scales. Depend on the interested scales modeling, the right selection of multi-scale methods leads to reliable results and affordable computational cost. The present dissertation deals with the problems in various length and time scales using computational methods include density functional theory (DFT), molecular mechanics (MM), molecular dynamics (MD), and finite element (FE) methods. Physical and chemical interactions in lower scales determine the coarser scale properties. Particles interaction modeling and exploring fundamental properties are significant challenges of computational science. Downscale modelings need more computational effort due to a large number of interacted atoms/particles. To deal with this problem and bring up a fine-scale (nano) as a coarse-scale (macro) problem, we extended an atomic-continuum framework. The discrete atomic models solve as a continuum problem using the computationally efficient FE method.

Background Many biochemical reactions depend on the pH of their environment and some are strongly accelerated in an acidic surrounding. A classical approach to control biochemical reactions non-invasivly is by changing the temperature. However, if the pH could be controlled by optical means using photo-active chemicals, this would mean to be able to accelerate suitable biochemical reactions. Optically switching the pH can be achieved by using photoacids. A photoacid is a molecule with a functional group that releases a proton upon irradiation with the suitable wavelength, acidifying the environmental aqueous surrounding. A major goal of this work was to establish a non-invasive method of optically controlling the pH in aqueous solutions, offering the opportunity to enhance the known chemical reactions portfolio.

This work introduces a novel extension of the Python software \"Environment for Combining Optimization and Simulation Software'' (EFCOSS). The extension addresses the solution of optimization problems of different types. Various problem instances that demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in new practical application scenarios include geothermal engineering and material science. In a more general context, EFCOSS enables to investigate the questions of which parameter values best fit a given computer model to measurements from real-world experiments, how should such experiments be designed with minimal uncertainty, which computer models should be used for a specific task, and how can the efficiency of such investigations be improved by using simpler models. These questions are addressed by employing techniques from parameter estimation, space mapping, optimal experimental design, and model identification that are implemented and brought together in EFCOSS. To this end, the internal structure of EFCOSS had to be redesigned completely to introduce a new software architecture based on standard Python packages. This new architecture allows for multiple optimization problems, objective functions, and simulation routines to be used within a single application. Simulation models of geothermal reservoirs in the regions of Perth in Australia and Tuscany in Italy are used as illustrating examples of optimal experimental design to find the location of new borehole sites that introduce low uncertainty in the parameter estimation. Furthermore, new parameter estimation problems are solved using space-mapping algorithms. Model identification is applied to metal-plasticity models to investigate different kinds of models.

Different infrared cameras were used to study the heat flux from the plasma onto the PFC. In the first publication, the limiter set-up was used with a simpler magnetic topology in the plasma edge. The radial fall-off of the parallel heat flux for inboard limiters in W7-X shows, similar to inboard limiters in tokamaks, two different radial fall-off lengths, a short (narrow) one, characterizing the near-SOL, and a long (broad) characterizing the far-SOL.

The two fall-off lengths differ by a factor 10, and the found scalings for both regimes differ from known models and experimental scalings in tokamaks.

Although it is impractical to avert subsequent natural disasters, advances in simulation science and seismological studies make it possible to lessen the catastrophic damage. There currently exists in many urban areas a large number of structures, which are prone to damage by earthquakes. These were constructed without the guidance of a national seismic code, either before it existed or before it was enforced. For instance, in Istanbul, Turkey, as a high seismic area, around 90% of buildings are substandard, which can be generalized into other earthquakeprone regions in Turkey. The reliability of this building stock resulting from earthquake-induced collapse is currently uncertain. Nonetheless, it is also not feasible to perform a detailed seismic vulnerability analysis on each building as a solution to the scenario, as it will be too complicated and expensive. This indicates the necessity of a reliable, rapid, and computationally easy method for seismic vulnerability assessment, commonly known as Rapid Visual Screening (RVS). In RVS methodology, an observational survey of buildings is performed, and according to the data collected during the visual inspection, a structural score is calculated without performing any structural calculations to determine the expected damage of a building and whether the building needs detailed assessment. Although this method might save time and resources due to the subjective/qualitative judgments of experts who performed the inspection, the evaluation process is dominated by vagueness and uncertainties, where the vagueness can be handled adequately through the fuzzy set theory but do not cover all sort of uncertainties due to its crisp membership functions. In this study, a novel method of rapid visual hazard safety assessment of buildings against earthquake is introduced in which an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) is used to cover uncertainties. In addition, the proposed method provides the possibility to evaluate the earthquake risk of the building by considering factors related to the building importance and exposure.

Ontologies are the prime way of organizing data in the Semantic Web. Often, it is necessary to combine several, independently developed ontologies to obtain a knowledge graph fully representing a domain of interest. Existing approaches scale rather poorly to the merging of multiple ontologies due to using a binary merge strategy. Thus, we aim to investigate the extent to which the n-ary strategy can solve the scalability problem. This thesis contributes to the following important aspects: 1. Our n-ary merge strategy takes as input a set of source ontologies and their mappings and generates a merged ontology. For efficient processing, rather than successively merging complete ontologies pairwise, we group related concepts across ontologies into partitions and merge first within and then across those partitions. 2. We take a step towards parameterizable merge methods. We have identified a set of Generic Merge Requirements (GMRs) that merged ontologies might be expected to meet. We have investigated and developed compatibilities of the GMRs by a graph-based method. 3. When multiple ontologies are merged, inconsistencies can occur due to different world views encoded in the source ontologies To this end, we propose a novel Subjective Logic-based method to handling the inconsistency occurring while merging ontologies. We apply this logic to rank and estimate the trustworthiness of conflicting axioms that cause inconsistencies within a merged ontology. 4. To assess the quality of the merged ontologies systematically, we provide a comprehensive set of criteria in an evaluation framework. The proposed criteria cover a variety of characteristics of each individual aspect of the merged ontology in structural, functional, and usability dimensions. 5. The final contribution of this research is the development of the CoMerger tool that implements all aforementioned aspects accessible via a unified interface.", "title_en": "Building high-quality merged ontologies from multiple sources with requirements customization"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4520890-6", "gnd:4688372-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1231549416; gnd:36164-1", "year": "2021", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

This book highlights and investigates novel solid-state luminescent properties of crystals with stimuli-responsive behavior.

The major goal of the material design concept was to capitalize on the chirality of crystals with stimuli-responsive properties. To allow crystals’ chirality to be controlled and modified by means of external stimulation, the axial chirality of biaryl moiety was employed and, interestingly, produced several novel mechano- and vapo-responsive luminescent properties based on crystal-to-crystal or single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase transitions. In addition, the book details how the molecular rotation of luminophores in the solid phase can be used to achieve corresponding thermal-responsive phosphorescence.

During the last century, navigation systems have become ubiquitous and guide drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians towards their desired destinations.

However, finding a gate within an airport, a ward within a hospital, or a university's auditorium also represent navigation problems. To provide navigation within such indoor environments, new approaches are required. This thesis examines pedestrian 3D indoor localization and navigation using commodity smartphones: A desirable target platform, always at hand and equipped with a multitude of sensors. The IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) and barometer allow for pedestrian dead reckoning, that is, estimating relative location changes. Absolute whereabouts can be determined via Wi-Fi, an infrastructure present within most public buildings, or by using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons as inexpensive supplement. The building's 3D floorplan not only enables navigation, but also increases accuracy by preventing impossible movements, and serves as a visual reference for the pedestrian. All aforementioned information is fused by recursive density estimation based on a particle filter. The conducted experiments cover both, theoretical backgrounds and real-world use-cases.

The computational analysis of argumentation strategies is substantial for many downstream applications.

This thesis principally approaches the analysis of the strategies manifested in the persuasive argumentative discourses that aim for persuasion as well as in the deliberative argumentative discourses that aim for consensus. To this end, the thesis presents a novel view of argumentation strategies for the above two goals. Based on this view, new models for pragmatic and stylistic argument attributes are proposed, new methods for the identification of the modelled attributes have been developed, and a new set of strategy principles in texts according to the identified attributes is presented and explored.

Fluids in the Earth's crust can move by creating and flowing through fractures, in a process called `hydraulic fracturing’. The tip-line of such fluid-filled fractures grows at locations where stress is larger than the strength of the rock. Where the tip stress vanishes, the fracture closes and the fluid-front retreats. If stress gradients exist on the fracture's walls, induced by fluid/rock density contrasts or topographic stresses, this results in an asymmetric shape and growth of the fracture, allowing for the contained batch of fluid to propagate through the crust. The state-of-the-art analytical and numerical methods to simulate fluid-filled fracture propagation are two-dimensional (2D). In this work I extend these to three dimensions (3D).

For design algorithms based on geometric optics, typically, a mapping between the irradiance distribution of the input and the target is assumed. In this thesis, the validity of the mapping assumption is analyzed from a physical-optics point of view. It is revealed that it is true only when all the operators in the system modeling are pointwise operators. With the physical-optics modeling techniques, a design strategy is provided that starts from a functional design and continues with a structural design. By applying the inverse method, the light-shaping problem is reduced to a Fourier pair synthesis. For the Fourier pair synthesis, a mapping-type algorithm is introduced in the homeomorphic case. In the proposed method, the solution of the mapping between the Fourier pair is integrable. Therefore, the output wavefront phase can be achieved in a single integration step. After designing the output wavefront phase, the functional embodiment is nothing other than a wavefront phase response (WPR) function. The structural design of light-shaping elements is developed with the obtained WPR function, or more directly with the output wavefront phase. The design of both a holographic optical element (HOE) and a freeform lens for light shaping is demonstrated. The element function of the HOE design is the same as the WPR function. The local grating model is then derived from its element function. A hybrid component by adding a curved surface to the HOE is suggested to reduce the grating effects from the HOE. For the design of a freeform lens, an algorithm is proposed that combines the output wavefront phase design and the construction of the freeform surface in an iterative way. The algorithm has no restriction about the input wavefront and the shape of the predefined surface. Moreover, the Fresnel effect of the freeform surface is also considered in the design.", "title_en": "Optical design for far-field light shaping"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4043650-0", "gnd:4154023-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1244183199; gnd:36164-1", "year": "2021", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

This book applies the convex integration method to multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations in the barotropic case as well as the full system with temperature. The convex integration technique, originally developed in the context of differential inclusions, was applied in the groundbreaking work of De Lellis and Székelyhidi to the incompressible Euler equations, leading to infinitely many solutions. This theory was later refined to prove non-uniqueness of solutions of the compressible Euler system, too. These non-uniqueness results all use an ansatz which reduces the equations to a kind of incompressible system to which a slight modification of the incompressible theory can be applied. This book presents, for the first time, a generalization of the De Lellis–Székelyhidi approach to the setting of compressible Euler equations. The structure of this book is as follows: after providing an accessible introduction to the subject, including the essentials of hyperbolic conservation laws, the idea of convex integration in the compressible framework is developed. The main result proves that under a certain assumption there exist infinitely many solutions to an abstract initial boundary value problem for the Euler system. Next some applications of this theorem are discussed, in particular concerning the Riemann problem. Finally there is a survey of some related results.

The main outcomes of this work are: (i) the analysis of the crossover from diffusive to ballistic spin transport regimes in ultraclean graphene nonlocal devices, and (ii) investigation of spin transport and spin dynamics phenomena (such as the (quantum) spin Hall effect) in novel topological materials, such as monolayer Weyl semimetals WeTe2 and MoTe2.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1786054744", "content": {"text": "Developments in Isogeometric Analysis and Application to High-Order Phase-Field Models of Biomembranes. Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a numerical method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which was introduced with the aim of integrating finite element analysis with computer-aided design systems. The main idea of the method is to use the same spline basis functions which describe the geometry in CAD systems for the approximation of solution fields in the finite element method (FEM). Originally, NURBS which is a standard technology employed in CAD systems was adopted as basis functions in IGA but there were several variants of IGA using other technologies such as T-splines, PHT splines, and subdivision surfaces as basis functions. In general, IGA offers two key advantages over classical FEM: (i) by describing the CAD geometry exactly using smooth, high-order spline functions, the mesh generation process is simplified and the interoperability between CAD and FEM is improved, (ii) IGA can be viewed as a high-order finite element method which offers basis functions with high inter-element continuity and therefore can provide a primal variational formulation of high-order PDEs in a straightforward fashion. The main goal of this thesis is to further advance isogeometric analysis by exploiting these major advantages, namely precise geometric modeling and the use of smooth high-order splines as basis functions, and develop robust computational methods for problems with complex geometry and/or complex multi-physics. As the first contribution of this thesis, we leverage the precise geometric modeling of isogeometric analysis and propose a new method for its coupling with meshfree discretizations. We exploit the strengths of both methods by using IGA to provide a smooth, geometrically-exact surface discretization of the problem domain boundary, while the Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM) discretization is used to provide the volumetric discretization of the domain interior. The coupling strategy is based upon the higher-order consistency or reproducing conditions that are directly imposed in the physical domain. The resulting coupled method enjoys several favorable features: (i) it preserves the geometric exactness of IGA, (ii) it circumvents the need for global volumetric parameterization of the problem domain, (iii) it achieves arbitrary-order approximation accuracy while preserving higher-order smoothness of the discretization. Several numerical examples are solved to show the optimal convergence properties of the coupled IGA–RKPM formulation, and to demonstrate its effectiveness in constructing volumetric discretizations for complex-geometry objects. As for the next contribution, we exploit the use of smooth, high-order spline basis functions in IGA to solve high-order surface PDEs governing the morphological evolution of vesicles. These governing equations are often consisted of geometric PDEs, high-order PDEs on stationary or evolving surfaces, or a combination of them. We propose an isogeometric formulation for solving these PDEs. In the context of geometric PDEs, we consider phase-field approximations of mean curvature flow and Willmore flow problems and numerically study the convergence behavior of isogeometric analysis for these problems. As a model problem for high-order PDEs on stationary surfaces, we consider the Cahn–Hilliard equation on a sphere, where the surface is modeled using a phase-field approach. As for the high-order PDEs on evolving surfaces, a phase-field model of a deforming multi-component vesicle, which consists of two fourth-order nonlinear PDEs, is solved using the isogeometric analysis in a primal variational framework. Through several numerical examples in 2D, 3D and axisymmetric 3D settings, we show the robustness of IGA for solving the considered phase-field models. Finally, we present a monolithic, implicit formulation based on isogeometric analysis and generalized-alpha time integration for simulating hydrodynamics of vesicles according to a phase-field model. Compared to earlier works, the number of equations of the phase-field model which need to be solved is reduced by leveraging high continuity of NURBS functions, and the algorithm is extended to 3D settings. We use residual-based variational multi-scale method (RBVMS) for solving Navier–Stokes equations, while the rest of PDEs in the phase-field model are treated using a standard Galerkin-based IGA. We introduce the resistive immersed surface (RIS) method into the formulation which can be employed for an implicit description of complex geometries using a diffuse-interface approach. The implementation highlights the robustness of the RBVMS method for Navier–Stokes equations of incompressible flows with non-trivial localized forcing terms including bending and tension forces of the vesicle. The potential of the phase-field model and isogeometric analysis for accurate simulation of a variety of fluid-vesicle interaction problems in 2D and 3D is demonstrated.", "title_en": "Developments in Isogeometric Analysis and Application to High-Order Phase-Field Models of Biomembranes"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4736241-8", "gnd:4026302-2", "gnd:4206141-6", "gnd:7675978-7", "gnd:7718401-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Valizadeh, Navid", "year": "2021", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

A comprehensive description and comparison of present market dissolving wood pulps (DWP) is provided. The systematic difference between kraft and sulfite pulps destined for the same application could be shown. Alkalization or alkaline extraction is the most common process operation when using DWP. A method to determine the degree of conversion to alkali cellulose as a result of alkalization based on Raman spectroscopy was developed. Extraction with 18 wt% aq.

The choice of steeping temperature was found to be important in order to balance yield and purity of xylan-containing pulps. DWP is usually dried prior to application.

Plant organs are colonized by diverse microbial organisms that help the plant to ensure fitness and survival in unpredictable environments. Different factors shape the microbiome of plants including the plant genotype, environmental conditions and microbe-microbe interactions. Certain highly interactive microbes were identified as keystone species in plant-associated microbial communities, i.e. species that are important for the structure and integrity of a community, regardless of its abundance in the ecosystem. Keystones in plant microbiomes could be important in structuring early colonization of plants by microorganisms and in controlling the variability of plant-associated microbiomes. The goal of this project was to evaluate the hypothesis that the plant microbiome is a combination of the microbiomes of the host and its keystones, focusing on early colonization. In this work a new amplicon sequencing pipeline was developed to investigate the leaf microbiomes of nine wild Arabidopsis thaliana population identified in Jena, Germany. We found, that their core microbiome is largely, but not completely shared with other co-habituating ground-dwelling ruderal plant species. The difference between A. thaliana bacteriomes and those of other plants depended on how variable bacteriomes were in each population, which changed between years in each population. We then tested the importance of early microbial colonization in two of the wild A. thaliana populations and one A. thaliana reference strain and identified efficient early colonizers as possible keystone species. We found, that if they influenced microbial community assembly they increased the variation of bacterial communities rather than decreasing it. To summarize, early colonizing bacteria affect the outcome of plant-to-plant variation. We hypothesize that these are bacterial keystone species that do not shape the plants microbiome in a specific way, but rather serve as cues leading to more variability.", "title_en": "Whose microbiome is it? : adaptive interactions of keystone species in plant microbiomes"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4169816-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1272156540; gnd:36164-1", "year": "2022", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

Three-dimensional shape measurement has become essential in many areas, such as quality control in industrial production or digitization of complex free-form surfaces. Stereo recording based on the principle of pattern projection is often used on diffusely reflecting surfaces. Objects with non-cooperative surfaces, such as transparent, shiny, absorbent, or translucent objects, could not be reliably recorded with this technology until now. In previous studies it was shown that the shape from heating approach can be used to record non-cooperative surfaces in three dimensions. This method is based on pattern projection in the thermal infrared, absorption under generation of a heat pattern, and stereo recording of the reemission. However, the measurement time in the double digit second range has been relatively long and the measurement accuracy insufficient for many applications. In this study, a simulation model for the entire thermal measurement process is developed. With the help of this tool, the interaction between the infrared radiation and the object as well as the generation of a temperature contrast is investigated. From this, limits of the multi-fringe projection are concluded and the novel projection principle of sequential fringes is developed. Instead of an areal multi-fringe projection, the new method irradiates the object only in locally strongly restricted areas. This results in irradiation times in the millisecond range, which drastically reduces the influence of thermal diffusion. The new 3D sensor based on sequential fringe projection has impressively demonstrated the advantages over multi-fringe projection.

Porous materials are an emerging branch of engineering materials that are composed of two elements: One element is a solid (matrix), and the other element is either liquid or gas. Pores can be distributed within the solid matrix of porous materials with different shapes and sizes. In addition, porous materials are lightweight, and flexible, and have higher resistance to crack propagation and specific thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties. These properties are necessary for manufacturing engineering structures such as beams and other engineering structures. These materials are widely used in solid mechanics and are considered a good replacement for classical materials by many researchers recently. Producing lightweight materials has been developed because of the possibility of exploiting the properties of these materials. Various types of porous material are generated naturally or artificially for a specific application such as bones and foams. Like functionally graded materials, pore distribution patterns can be uniform or non-uniform. Biot’s theory is a well-developed theory to study the behavior of poroelastic materials which investigates the interaction between fluid and solid phases of a fluid-saturated porous medium. Functionally graded porous materials (FGPM) are widely used in modern industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and biomechanics. These advanced materials have some specific properties compared to materials with a classic structure. They are extremely light, while they have specific strength in mechanical and high-temperature environments. FGPMs are characterized by a gradual variation of material parameters over the volume. Although these materials can be made naturally, it is possible to design and manufacture them for a specific application. Therefore, many studies have been done to analyze the mechanical and thermal properties of FGPM structures, especially beams. Biot was the pioneer in formulating the linear elasticity and thermoelasticity equations of porous material. Since then, Biot's formulation has been developed in continuum mechanics which is named poroelasticity. There are obstacles to analyzing the behavior of these materials accurately like the shape of the pores, the distribution of pores in the material, and the behavior of the fluid (or gas) that saturated pores. Indeed, most of the engineering structures made of FGPM have nonlinear governing equations. Therefore, it is difficult to study engineering structures by solving these complicated equations. The main purpose of this dissertation is to analyze porous materials in engineering structures. For this purpose, the complex equations of porous materials have been simplified and applied to engineering problems so that the effect of all parameters of porous materials on the behavior of engineering structure has been investigated. The effect of important parameters of porous materials on beam behavior including pores compressibility, porosity distribution, thermal expansion of fluid within pores, the interaction of stresses between pores and material matrix due to temperature increase, effects of pore size, material thickness, and saturated pores with fluid and unsaturated conditions are investigated. Two methods, the deep energy method, and the exact solution have been used to reduce the problem hypotheses, increase accuracy, increase processing speed, and apply these in engineering structures. In both methods, they are analyzed nonlinear and complex equations of porous materials. To increase the accuracy of analysis and study of the effect of shear forces, Timoshenko and Reddy's beam theories have been used. Also, neural networks such as residual and fully connected networks are designed to have high accuracy and less processing time than other computational methods.zeige weniger", "title_en": "Analysis of Functionally Graded Porous Materials Using Deep Energy Method and Analytical Solution"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4313842-1", "gnd:4046811-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Mojahedin, Arvin", "year": "2022", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

There is a palpable tension between the planning and implementation of climate targets, for instance as regards renewable energy resources - among which wind power plays a significant role. This tension comes to the fore when assessing the effectiveness of spatial planning approaches to the deployment of wind energy. Planning approaches to wind power are evaluated in three European urbanised regions: South Holland (Netherlands), Lower Austria (Austria) and East Flanders (Belgium). Each region has adopted wind energy targets and introduced zoned areas in its regional planning agenda. The theory of ‘new institutionalism’ and the comparative case study method are the two pillars of this investigation. Zoning may be considered as a form of institutional design, for the introduction of zoned areas not only determines the territorial spread of wind turbines, but also configures socio-organisational entities and actors involved in implementation (developers, local residents, consultants, and public authorities). The comparative approach demonstrates that planning choices in the three case studies often yield to the concerns of higher governance levels, clearly prioritising energy policy goals above local, contextual values. In consequence, ‘zones for wind energy’ do not always gain public acceptance at the local level. Indeed, the foundation for locally supported wind energy zones is laid down in the planning process itself. This process has the potential to institutionalise a trade-off between collective purposes at a higher governance level and locally changing contexts and values. On the other hand, planning agents need to be more aware of path dependencies in spatial decisions concerning renewable energy. One of the wider implications of the planning approaches studied is that they restrict, rather than promote development. Thus, when zoned areas had to be redrawn, local opposition or ‘unwillingness’ seriously restricted the amount of leeway for reaching a consensus about alternative locations. The reason was that the formal planning exercise (zoning wind energy) implied more than an impartial territorial designation: it also communicated social consensus on land-use decisions of ´where wind turbines would come´ and ´where they would not´", "title_en": "Wind power deployment in urbanised regions : an institutional analysis of planning and implementation"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4048590-0", "gnd:4128839-7", "gnd:4056763-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1277073341", "year": "2020", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1842688383", "content": {"text": "Measurement of the Indoor Air Temperature Distribution using Acoustic Travel-Time Tomography. One of the main criteria determining the thermal comfort of occupants is the air temperature. To monitor this parameter, a thermostat is traditionally mounted in the indoor environment for instance in office rooms in the workplaces, or directly on the radiator or in another location in a room. One of the drawbacks of this conventional method is the measurement at a certain location instead of the temperature distribution in the entire room including the occupant zone. As a result, the climatic conditions measured at the thermostat point may differ from those at the user's location. This not only negatively impacts the thermal comfort assessment but also leads to a waste of energy due to unnecessary heating and cooling. Moreover, for measuring the distribution of the air temperature under laboratory conditions, multiple thermal sensors should be installed in the area under investigation. This requires high effort in both installation and expense. To overcome the shortcomings of traditional sensors, Acoustic travel-time TOMography (ATOM) offers an alternative based on measuring the transmission sound velocity signals. The basis of the ATOM technique is the first-order dependency of the sound velocity on the medium's temperature. The average sound velocity, along the propagation paths, can be determined by travel-times estimation of a defined acoustic signal between transducers. After the travel-times collection, the room is divided into several volumetric grid cells, i.e. voxels, whose sizes are defined depending on the dimension of the room and the number of sound paths. Accordingly, the spatial air temperature in each voxel can be determined using a suitable tomographic algorithm. Recent studies indicate that despite the great potential of this technique to detect room climate, few experiments have been conducted. This thesis aims to develop the ATOM technique for indoor climatic applications while coupling the analysis methods of tomography and room acoustics. The method developed in this thesis uses high-energy early reflections in addition to the direct paths between transducers for travel time estimation. In this way, reflections can provide multiple sound paths that allow the room coverage to be maintained even when a few or even only one transmitter and receiver are used. In the development of the ATOM measurement system, several approaches have been employed, including the development of numerical methods and simulations and conducting experimental measurements, each of which has contributed to the improvement of the system's accuracy. In order to effectively separate the early reflections and ensure adequate coverage of the room with sound paths, a numerical method was developed based on the optimization of the coordinates of the sound transducers in the test room. The validation of the optimal positioning method shows that the reconstructed temperatures were significantly improved by placing the transducers at the optimal coordinates derived from the developed numerical method. The other numerical method developed is related to the selection of the travel times of the early reflections. Accordingly, the detection of the travel times has been improved by adjusting the lengths of the multiple analysis time-windows according to the individual travel times in the reflectogram of the room impulse response. This can reduce the probability of trapping faulty travel times in the analysis time-windows. The simulation model used in this thesis is based on the image source model (ISM) method for simulating the theoretical travel times of early reflection sound paths. The simulation model was developed to simulate the theoretical travel times up to third-order reflections. The empirical measurements were carried out in the climate lab of the Chair of Building Physics under different boundary conditions, i.e., combinations of different room air temperatures under both steady-state and transient conditions, and different measurement setups. With the measurements under controllable conditions in the climate lab, the validity of the developed numerical methods was confirmed. In this thesis, the performance of the ATOM measurement system was evaluated using two measurement setups. The setup for the initial investigations consists of an omnidirectional receiver and a near omnidirectional sound source, keeping the number of transducers as few as possible. This has led to accurately identify the sources of error that could occur in each part of the measuring system. The second measurement setup consists of two directional sound sources and one omnidirectional receiver. This arrangement of transducers allowed a higher number of well-detected travel times for tomography reconstruction, a better travel time estimation due to the directivity of the sound source, and better space utilization. Furthermore, this new measurement setup was tested to determine an optimal selection of the excitation signal. The results showed that for the utilized setup, a linear chirp signal with a frequency range of 200 - 4000 Hz and a signal duration of t = 1 s represents an optimal selection with respect to the reliability of the measured travel times and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To evaluate the performance of the measuring setups, the ATOM temperatures were always compared with the temperatures of high-resolution NTC thermistors with an accuracy of ±0.2 K. The entire measurement program, including acoustic measurements, simulation, signal processing, and visualization of measurement results are performed in MATLAB software. In addition, to reduce the uncertainty of the positioning of the transducers, the acoustic centre of the loudspeaker was determined experimentally for three types of excitation signals, namely MLS (maximum length sequence) signals with different lengths and duration, linear and logarithmic chirp signals with different defined frequency ranges. For this purpose, the climate lab was converted into a fully anechoic chamber by attaching absorption panels to the entire surfaces of the room. The measurement results indicated that the measurement of the acoustic centre of the sound source significantly reduces the displacement error of the transducer position. Moreover, to measure the air temperature in an occupied room, an algorithm was developed that can convert distorted signals into pure reference signals using an adaptive filter. The measurement results confirm the validity of the approach for a temperature interval of 4 K inside the climate lab. Accordingly, the accuracy of the reconstructed temperatures indicated that ATOM is very suitable for measuring the air temperature distribution in rooms.", "title_en": "Measurement of the Indoor Air Temperature Distribution using Acoustic Travel-Time Tomography"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4168286-5", "gnd:4048567-5", "gnd:4048584-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5180842-0; gnd:128659345X", "year": "2023", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Making decisions is an integral part of everyday life, yet it can be a difficult and complex process. While peoples’ wants and needs are unlimited, resources are often scarce, making it necessary to research the possible alternatives and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. Nowadays, the Internet has become the main source of information when it comes to comparing alternatives, making search engines the primary means for collecting new information. However, relying only on term matching is not sufficient to adequately address requests for comparisons. Therefore, search systems should go beyond this approach to effectively address comparative information needs. In this dissertation, I explore from different perspectives how search systems can respond to comparative questions. First, I examine approaches to identifying comparative questions and study their underlying information needs. Second, I investigate a methodology to identify important constituents of comparative questions like the to-be-compared options and to detect the stance of answers towards these comparison options. Then, I address ambiguous comparative search queries by studying an interactive clarification search interface. And finally, addressing answering comparative questions, I investigate retrieval approaches that consider not only the topical relevance of potential answers but also account for the presence of arguments towards the comparison options mentioned in the questions. By addressing these facets, I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively satisfy the information needs of searchers seeking to compare different alternatives.", "title_en": "Understanding comparative questions and retrieving argumentative answers"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4134011-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:36164-1; gnd:1194010539", "year": "2023", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

Finding relevant research data is an increasingly important but time-consuming task in daily research practice. Several studies report on difficulties in dataset search, e.g., scholars retrieve only partial pertinent data, and important information can not be displayed in the user interface. Overcoming these problems has motivated a number of research efforts in computer science, such as text mining and semantic search. In particular, the emergence of the Semantic Web opens a variety of novel research perspectives. Motivated by these challenges, the overall aim of this work is to analyze the current obstacles in dataset search and to propose and develop a novel semantic dataset search. The studied domain is biodiversity research, a domain that explores the diversity of life, habitats and ecosystems. This thesis has three main contributions: (1) We evaluate the current situation in dataset search in a user study, and we compare a semantic search with a classical keyword search to explore the suitability of semantic web technologies for dataset search. (2) We generate a question corpus and develop an information model to figure out on what scientific topics scholars in biodiversity research are interested in. Moreover, we also analyze the gap between current metadata and scholarly search interests, and we explore whether metadata and user interests match. (3) We propose and develop an improved dataset search based on three components: (A) a text mining pipeline, enriching metadata and queries with semantic categories and URIs, (B) a retrieval component with a semantic index over categories and URIs and (C) a user interface that enables a search within categories and a search including further hierarchical relations.

The work presented in this dissertation is dedicated to the characterization of the excited state dynamics of thin films through time-resolved spectroscopy, with emphasis on developing a methodology that is able to resolve weak transient absorption signals from optically thin films. With this aim, the conventional transient absorption spectroscopy method is first utilized to characterize semiconducting monolayers and organic nanosheet semiconductors. Although these are physically thin, they present relatively strong transient absorption signals of a few mOD (units of optical density), which allows to characterize their excited state dynamics with the conventional machinery, not needing further signal enhancements or complex noise-minimizing techniques. Nonetheless, the former does not represent the reality of detecting the transient photoexcited dynamics of few-layered systems. For this reason, the last chapter of this thesis introduces a new approach for the sensitive detection of two-dimensional samples with marginal molecular extinction coefficients: A novel methodology that multiplies the interaction length of the light with the sample, designated cavity ring-down transient absorption spectroscopy (CRD-TAS).

Photosynthetic microorganisms, including microalgae and cyanobacteria, account to half of global CO2 fixation. Light governs their photosynthesis and other biological functions. Specifically, cryptochromes, photoreceptors found universally, primarily detect UV-A/blue light and are known to repair DNA. This study focuses on five algal cryptochromes, especially CRY-DASH1 (Drosophila, Arabidopsis, Synechocystis, Homo) in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Located in the chloroplast, CRY-DASH1's expression peaks around midday. A mutant lacking CRY-DASH1 showed decreased growth but enhanced photosynthesis efficiency. Furthermore, the mutant revealed increased pigment amounts, hyper-stacking of the thylakoid membrane and elevated levels of photosystem II proteins like D1 and CP43, but not of their transcripts. These data suggest that CRY-DASH1 plays its role as regulator at the posttranscriptional/translational level. CRY-DASH1 has an absorption peak in the UV-A range and supplementation of white light with UV-A increases photoautotrophic growth of wild type but not of the mutant lacking CRY-DASH1. Comparative analysis of the chloroplast proteome of wild type and of the mutant revealed that multiple proteins, including key enzymes for the synthesis of chlorophylls and carotenoids, as well as acyl-lipid metabolism and photoprotection, are upregulated in the mutant. In contrast, we found that essential proteins from the central carbon metabolism, are downregulated. Additionally, we discovered that the mutant revealed a downregulation of certain enzymes involved in histidine metabolism which leads to a reduction in the quantity of free histidine. Another cryptochrome, CRY-DASH2, when mutated, exhibited similar growth reduction and pigment increase.

Numerical relativity (NR) simulations are crucial for studying the coalescence of compact binaries.

In the context of binary neutron star merger simulations, we perform the first systematic study comparing results obtained with various neutrino treatments, the presence of turbulent viscosity and different grid resolutions. We find that the time of BH formation after merger is heavily affected by grid resolution and turbulent viscosity. An early BH formation limits matter ejection from the accretion disc, as the BH swallows a significant portion of it. Our results indicate that more reliable kilonova light curves are obtained only if the various ejecta components are present. Moreover, robust r-process nucleosynthesis yields require inclusion of both neutrino emission and reabsorption in simulations. Advanced neutrino schemes and turbulent viscosity in simulations resolved beyond current standards appear necessary for reliable astrophysical predictions.

More specifically, I examine the significance of artistic engagement with the house in the period around 1860, a field proving to be particularly productive, especially in England: in an era of bourgeois prosperity and self-esteem, the house was in vogue and, consequently, was deliberately constructed as an interior.

The way to sustainable chemical production will require carbon capture technologies that allow abundant and cheap carbon dioxide to be available, to be used in carbon fixation processes. Among the non-photosynthetic biological carbon fixation processes, the ones catalyzed by acetogenic bacteria such as gas fermentation and microbial electrosynthesis stand out. Both processes are limited in terms of the range of products they can offer, and although gas fermentation has already reached the industrial scale, microbial electrosynthesis is a process with great potential but still new and not yet developed. The deepening of our knowledge about the metabolism of acetogenic bacteria such as Clostridium ljungdahlii, as well as the development of molecular tools, is crucial for the expansion of the portfolio of products that acetogens can offer. In this thesis, the mode of extracellular electron transfer and the role of hydrogen in microbial electrosynthesis with C. ljungdahlii is unveiled, leading to highly productive planktonic systems that decouple activity from biofilm formation. Furthermore, it is proposed that two putative glycine-based carbon fixation pathways are activated under redox stress conditions, leading to the production in significant quantities of metabolites that are rarely found in microbial electrosynthesis or gas fermentation. The in-situ formation of electrocatalysts promotes the formation of formate on carbon-based cathodes, likely boosting C. ljungdahlii growth, and it represents a promising finding for the future development of catalytic cathodes. The development of molecular tools allowed to establish in C. ljungdahlii an anaerobic fluorescent marker, CRISPR/Cas systems for the generation of deletions, and a heterologous expression system to produce ethyl acetate from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

Natural selection is expected to drive evolution towards a small number of the most beneficial chemical defences. However, in the genus Asclepias there is a high diversity of cardenolides, a compound class that target the Na+/K+—ATPase enzyme. The specialised herbivores of Asclepias are hypothesised to impose selection for chemical defences. One major objective of this thesis was to test whether cardenolides in the seeds of Asclepias curassavica defend against the specialist seed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. For this, ten compounds were isolated from A. curassavica seeds, three of those new and seven previously reported. Glucopyranosyl frugoside is the most abundant cardenolide in this tissue, and there was a significant variation in the compounds’ inhibition of the unadapted Na+/K+—ATPase. To test whether the variability in cardenolides in the seeds could represent the plant's response to selection by O. fasciatus; cardenolide analysis of the seeds and O. fasciatus was combined with tests of the inhibitory capacity of a subset of compounds against of O. fasciatus and a non-adapted insect target sites. Frugoside and gofruside were more concentrated in the bugs than is available in their diet and had contrasting potency toward the O. fasciatus target site. Thus, the accumulation of these compounds could not be explained by their availability in seeds or the biological activity on the bug’s target site. To test an alternative hypothesis that the plant chemodiversity and sequestration patterns of O. fasciatus are explained by natural selection by the third trophic level. The inhibitory properties of cardenolides in O. fasciatus were tested against several predator target sites. Glucopyranosyl frugoside and frugoside were toxic for both resistant and sensitive predators, whereas gofruside had varying degrees of inhibitory capacity.

The functionality of the concept is shown with the outer flap of the A340 as a reference system. The structural behaviour (stiffness and stress) of the different components is analysed. An actuator system is selected and designed where only two actuators are necessary. The coupling of the individual horns is made with elastic rods. It is shown that such an actuator system fulfils all requirements. With the construction of a demonstrator the practical functionality is analysed. For the manufacturing of the hornlike structures with carbon fiber a special manufacturing process is developed and tested. The process is used for the assembly of the demonstrator. With lifecycle tests the stability of the structure is proved. A finite element model of the whole system with the interacting of horn structure and skin is developed. With this model and with the results of experimental analysis an optimum configuration is found by observance the stiffness requirements. It can be shown that in all load cases the stresses for the structural components are in the limits and the functionality of the concept is kept.", "title_en": "Das Hornkonzept, Realisierung eines formvariablen Tragflügelprofils zur aerodynamischen Leistungsoptimierung zukünftiger Verkehrsflugzeuge"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4190146-0", "gnd:4128805-1", "gnd:4164540-6", "gnd:4416089-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2000", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

This thesis introduces a solution to the problem of image restoration and feature extraction by incorporating new image models derived from statistical physics. Starting from Shannon's model of information processing, a special lattice spin Hamiltonian is used which is well suited for both source coding and for modeling information loss within the Bayesian framework. By applying a high-temperature expansion the parameter estimation problem is solved analytically using transfer-matrix methods. A Monte Carlo simulation restores the distorted image utilizing the statistical information about the source and the channel. Beyond its inherent practical usefulness the image restoration problem illustrates directly basic concepts related to information theory, statistical inference, and perception. The work is split mainly in two parts: Chapters 1 to 4 contain a summary of the problem and existing models, Chapters 5 to 7 introduce the new models and illustrate their capabilities in a variety of experiments.

This work focuses on 'statistical cocktail party processing': localization, tracking, and enhancement of voices in concurrent speech or in high levels of nonstationary noise. Key strategies are to link binaural and spectro-temporal information, to combine cues across frequency and time by a probabilistic approach, and to treat speech as a multidimensional stochastic signal, using a priori knowledge about it. To implement these, Bayesian estimation, sequential Monte Carlo methods, and statistical evaluation of speech databases are used. Three on-line algorithms are developed and tested, which run partly in real-time. They allow for a robust, efficient and exact sound localization even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and successful tracking and separation of voices with convergence times between 50 and 200 ms.

Program annotations can be used to improve the analysis and optimizitation process of a JIT compiler. Program annotations allow a mobile code system derive information about a program, on the producer side, and transmit that information along with the program to the consumer side.

Climate models predict an increasing frequency and intensity of summer drought periods with subsequent heavy rainfall or soil frost and thaw events in mountain regions of Central Europe. These indirect effects of global warming may considerably influence soil microbial processes and in consequence emissions of climate-relevant trace gases. Regarding the nitrogen cycle, N2O and NO emissions are of concern, since they are involved in climate warming and soils represent a main source for these two gases. In spite of a growing number of studies on this subject, knowledge on effects of climate change on soil N2O and NO emissions is still scarce. This is mainly due to a hitherto poor mechanistic understanding of underlying processes within soil. In this thesis, the impact of extreme meteorological boundary conditions on N2O and NO fluxes in a Norway spruce forest and an acidic fen in the Fichtelgebirge area was investigated. The summer drought period and precipitation were experimentally increased in the forest and the fen over a 2-year span. Soil frost was induced in the forest by removal of the natural snow cover. The experiments were run in three replicates each and non-manipulated plots served as controls. Throughout the experiments, N2O and NO fluxes were recorded in weekly to monthly intervals. In addition, N2O concentrations and isotope signatures in soil air were measured along soil profiles to identify and localise the underlying biogenic production and consumption processes. Prolonged drought continuously reduced the N2O emission from the forest soil and even turned the soil temporarily into a sink for atmospheric N2O. Soil freezing and thawing caused a burst of N2O release contributing 84 % of the annual emission ...", "title_en": "Dynamics and underlying processes of N2O and NO soil-atmosphere exchange under extreme meteorological boundary conditions"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4146122-8", "gnd:4183276-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:137692072", "year": "2009", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

The measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays is an important tool to reveal the nature of cosmic rays. In order to measure the cosmic rays up to an energy of 10**18 eV, the KASCADE experiment was extended to KASCADE-Grande. It is a ground based detector to measure extensive air showers, which are initiated by the primary particles of the cosmic radiation. In order to obtain the energy spectrum, data from December 2003 to September 2007 are analyzed by using the method of constant intensity. This method is applied to the number of charged particles in an air shower and leads to a zenith angle independent number of charged particles, which is a measure of the shower size. Simulations of air showers are then used to calibrate the shower size to the primary energy. Thus, the primary energy spectrum in the energy range of 10**16 eV to 10**18 eV is determined. In the energy region from 10**16 eV to 10**17 eV the resulting spectrum and the spectrum measured with KASCADE overlap. Both measurements are in good agreement in this energy range. Due to the extended energy range, the energy spectrum of KASCADE-Grande connects the KASCADE spectrum with the measurements of experiments like AGASA, Auger and HiRes, which measure up to the highest energies of cosmic rays.", "title_en": "The energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays measured with the KASCADE-Grande experiment"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4320702-9", "gnd:4165371-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:136082777", "year": "2008", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

In this work the synthesis and characterization of small, stable and fluorescent poly-(acrylamide) NPs for sensing of chloride ions and pH is presented. The NPs were prepared by inverse microemulsion polymerization and characterized regarding their structural and fluorescence properties. Nearly all of the described NPs formed stable colloidal solutions in water and possessed a small diameter, sufficient monodispersity and a neutral surface-potential. Two different kinds of sensor particles were prepared: chloride-sensitive NPs with a physically entrapped indicator fluorophore and pH-sensitive NPs with a covalently bound indicator dye. The co-polymerization of a reference dye enabled ratiometric measurements in suspensions with both types of nanosensors. The nanosensors showed good response to the respective analyte, although the sensitivity was reduced by incorporation of the fluorophores inside the polymer matrix. The polymer matrix protected the fluorophores from undesired interaction with proteins and at the same time allowed small ionic analytes to pass through the polymer. The chloride nanosensors were transferred into living cells and their response was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy. After transfection of the cells, the NPs were located partially in small cellular organelles (endosomes) as well as in the cytosol. In order to enhance the cellular uptake and to force the endosomal escape of the NPs, different methods of functionalization were evaluated. Therefore, novel core-shell NPs with pH-independent size and a positive ?-potential were developed.

Moreover, a method was derived to predict properties of the electron density distribution quantitatively via combinations of vibrational spectroscopic and NMR spectroscopic data.

The Central Pacific area of Costa Rica is a convergent erosional margin, characterized by a high seismicity rate, coincident with the subduction of rough-relief ocean floor.

This study uses the records from a temporal seismological network, consisting of on- and offshore stations, installed for a period of six months in this segment of the Middle American margin. The aim was to obtain a model of the 3-D velocity structure of the margin and to characterize the seismicity of the shallow part (< 70 km depth) of the subduction zone, with the focus on the seismogenic zone. A subset of well locatable events was selected to calculate a minimum 1-D model for the P-wave velocity.

Factor H binds to host cells and blocks the alternative complement activation to prevent cell- and tissue damages. In addition, Factor H binds the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP).

Unpolished and polished bleached black slate samples were colonized best by fungal hyphae. The hyphae often entered pores. Etch pits induced by fungal activity could be observed which were then quantified by vertical scanning interferometry (VSI). The etch pits measured 3 4 ?m in width and 180 200 nm in depth. In contrast to black slate samples, more etch pits were found on graphite surfaces. Moreover, they showed a more elongated morphology and branches reminiscent of fungal growth morphology. Under laboratory conditions, Schizophyllum commune was able to degrade about 0.03 ?m3/?m2 rock material during 3 months of incubation. It could be shown that collapsed hyphae material remained in their etch pits even after sample preparation which was caused by strong fungal fixation to the rock surfaces. The higher carbon content and the softness of pressed graphite thus allow for earlier fungal attachment and higher dissolution rates.

Impurity ions pose a potentially serious threat to fusion plasma performance by affecting the confinement in various, usually deleterious, ways. Due to the creation of helium ash during fusion reactions and the interaction of the plasma with the wall components, which makes it possible for heavy ions to penetrate into the core plasma, impurities can intrinsically not be avoided. Therefore, it is essential to study their behaviour in the fusion plasma in detail. Within the framework of this thesis, different problems arising in connection with impurities have been investigated. 1. Collisional damping of zonal flows in tokamkas: The effect of impurities on the collisional damping of zonal flows is investigated. Since the Coulomb collision frequency increases with increasing ion charge, heavy, highly charged impurities play an important role in this process. The effect of such impurities on the linear response of the plasma to an external potential perturbation, as caused by zonal flows, is calculated with analytical methods and compared with numerical simulations, resulting in good agreement. 2. Impurity transport driven by microturbulence in tokamaks: Fine scale turbulence driven by microinstabilities is a source of particle and heat transport in a fusion reactor.

Previous screening of more than 50 marine bacteria had shown that many of them produced WE on incubation with different plant oils. WE produced on rapeseed oil (RP) resembled WE in human sebum. Selected n-fatty acid, n-alcohol, n-alkane or triacylglyceride substrates led to the formation of WE with their acid and alcohol moieties mainly directly derived from the substrates. Additional WE of different chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation showed that the bacterium shortened, elongated or desaturated the substrate’s carbon chains before WE synthesis. n-Alcohols were most suitable considering the amounts of WE produced. Two-component mixtures revealed selective WE metabolism. n-Alcohols plus RP led to variable amounts of WE and an extended WE spectrum compared to n-alcohols alone. Tripalmitate, RP or n-hexadecene with C16 substrates reduced WE production compared to the C16 compounds alone.

In S. avermitilis such reaction could be monitored by analyzing the frequently observed guttation droplets, which might serve as reservoir for secondary metabolites in streptomycetes and fungi. Analyses showed that S. avermitilis formed guttation droplets mainly contained sucrose. S. avermitilis produced the sucrose from the nutrients of the medium. As reaction coculture with P. fluorescens the reduction of available sucrose amount was detected. This suggests that the sucrose could serve as energy storage, which is mobilized under the competitive pressure in the mixed culture.

Tropical deforestation and forest degradation contributes to more than 20% of the global greenhouse gases emitted. Deforestation and its impacts can be more easily estimated with satellite images. Concerning forest degradation, it is difficult with the actual satellite image resolutions to evaluate accurately logging and biomass damage resulting from this activity though it contributes substantially to carbon emissions in the tropics. With increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, there is an urgent need of reliable biomass estimates and carbon pools in tropical forests, most especially in Africa where there is a serious lack of data. Moist tropical forests store large amounts of carbon and need accurate allometric regressions for their estimation. In Africa the absence of species-specific or mixed-species allometric equations has lead to a broad use of pan moist tropical equations to estimate tree biomass. This lack of information has raised many discussions on the accuracy of these data, since equations were derived from biomass collected outside Africa. Developing site-specific equations and pan-moist tropical equations including data from Africa is becoming very important for most ecologists for accurate estimations of this contribution extend, necessary for adaptation and mitigation strategies on climate change impacts. Allometric equations are key tools for climate change scenarios since they are used for estimating biomass and carbon pool at local, regional and world level. Information on net primary production (NPP) resulting from direct biomass field measurements of annual tree ring width is crucial in this context, to know how forest ecosystems will grow in the future with their possible impacts on carbon pools and fluxes and also to calibrate eddy covariance measurements ...", "title_en": "Ecological management of tropical forests: implications for climate change and carbon fluxes"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4164552-2", "gnd:7547705-1", "gnd:4006877-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:143789031", "year": "2010", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

The purpose of the dissertation work is to study theoretically and experimentally the influence of the additional photoelastic contribution to the modulation of the optical properties by the space-charge field and the effect of the optical activity on self-focusing and self-bending of laser beams. We have developed a theoretical model of self-action of one-dimensional light beams in (1 1 0) and (1 1 -2)-cut photorefractive sillenite crystals of point group 23 taking into account the additional contribution of the photoelastic effect to the optical properties of the medium, the induced birefringence and the optical activity. The additional photoelastic contribution to the optical properties of the photorefractive cubic medium in some cases can reduce the necessary value of the electric field amplitude by a factor of 1.7 to observe the same magnitude of the self-action effect as in existing theoretical models. he presented theoretical model predicts the possibility to observe quasi-solitons in cubic photorefractive crystals with a large magnitude of optical activity. he experimental and theoretical studies of the laser beam self-bending in bismuth titanium oxide crystals under applied external alternating fields showed that the self-bending magnitude, the self-bending direction and the form of the beam on the output face of the crystal can be controlled by the input polarization of propagated light if the bias field is applied along the direction [1 -1 1]. theoretical model for the investigation of the self-bending effect in barium titanate crystal (BaTiO3) for a speckled extraordinary light beam taking into account the additional elasto-optic contribution was developed for the first time.

The focus of this thesis is the engineering and analysis of the enantioselectivity of esterases using 3-phenylbutyric acid (3-PBA) as model substrate. An ultra high throughput assay for identification of enantioselective esterases has been developed, based on the combination of in vivo selection and flow cytometry. The in vivo selection medium consists of a couple of pseudo-enantiomers of 3-PBA; one enantiomer is coupled to glycerol (GE), and hydrolysis of this substrate will enable cell survival. The other enantiomer is coupled to the toxin 2,3-dibromopropanol (BE), the hydrolysis of this substrate will cause cell death. Thus, cell survival is a function of the enantioselectivity of the enzyme expressed. The pseudo-enantiomeric substrates are structurally similar to allow selection for enantioselectivity instead of selection for enzyme substrate affinity. Next, esterase BS2 was chosen as negative control to establish the selection system since it hydrolyses both pseudo-enantiomers with low enantioselectivity (E~3 and 1, respectively). High enantioselective esterases towards 3-PBA: esterases PestE and CL1 (E > 100, both (R)-selective) were identified in a screening and used as positive controls. Further, the hyperthermophilic esterase PestE was crystallized. After elucidation of the enzyme structure, the high enantioselectivity of the enzyme towards 3-PBA could be explained by molecular modelling ...

The present study investigates the effect of root volatiles on the orientation behaviour of cockchafer larvae Melolontha hippocastani in the soil. Cockchafer larvae are known as severe pests in agriculture and forestry. The present study adresses three relevant aspects of their chemical ecology linked to food choice belowground: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of several potential host plant roots and shoots are investigated and analysed by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The obtained volatile patterns of damaged roots differ clearly from the undamaged ones. Emitted shoot volatiles differ clearly from the emitted root volatiles. Electrophysiological methods are employed to record sensory reactions of the detached larval antennae to several of the previously identified compounds. Volatile emissions of Quercus sp. are investigated in detail. By using electroantennography (EAG), changes in the receptor potential elicited by odour stimuli are recorded. It turns out that seasonal and maybe also circadian rhythms appear to play an important role in cockchafer larvae antenna physiology. The behavioural response of cockchafer larvae is tested on selected compounds. A dual choice test setup is designed to study the behavioural orientation of the belowground living larvae. Attractive and repellent compounds in host plants are identified.

The results are also adaptable to the context of nonlinear least squares problems subject to nonlinear equality constraints. Special emphasis is put on structured problems from a multiple-shooting context to solve boundary value problems for ODEs or to solve parameter estimation problems for ODEs.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) are human pathogens, which are able to pass the host nasopharyngeal barriers and cause severe diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia. As pneumococci are members of the order of lactobacillales, the major catabolite of carbohydrate metabolism under aerobe and microaerophilic atmosphere is lactate. However S. pneumoniae synthesizes also a large fraction of ABC transporter systems involved in uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates, soluble compounds and amino acids. Here we started to analyze carbon metabolism by 13C isotopologue perturbation after growth of pneumococci in chemically defined media (CDM) in the presence of [U-13C6]glucose or [1,2-13C2]glucose as the sole C-source. GC/MS analysis showed a pattern of labeled and non labeled amino acids. The results suggest that pneumococci take up specific amino acids, while others are synthesized de novo by classical or non-classical biosynthesis pathways. His, Glu, Ile, Leu, Val, Pro and Gly remain unlabeled, which is a hint for the lack of de novo synthesis pathways or their regulation under certain environmental conditions.

It is demonstrated how the flexible framework of Bayesian hierarchical space-time models can be applied to oceanographic processes such as significant wave height in order to describe dependence structures and uncertainties in the data. This monograph is a research book and it is in some sense cross-disciplinary. The methodology itself is firmly rooted in the statistical research tradition, based on probability theory and stochastic processes. However, the methodology has been applied to a problem within physical oceanography, analysing data for significant wave height, which are of crucial importance to ocean engineering disciplines. Indeed, the statistical properties of significant wave height are important for the design, construction and operation of ships and other marine and coastal structures. Furthermore, the book addresses the question of whether climate change has an effect of the ocean wave climate, and if so what these effects might be. Thus, this book is an important contribution to the on-going debate on climate change, its implications and how to adapt to a changing climate, with a particular focus on the maritime industries and the marine environment. This book should be of general interest to anyone with an interest in statistical modelling of environmental processes, and in particular to those with a particular interest in the ocean wave climate. It is written on a level that should be understandable to everyone with a basic background in statistics or elementary mathematics, and an introduction to some basic concepts is given in appendices for the uninitiated reader. The intended readership includes students and professionals involved in statistics, oceanography, ocean engineering, environmental research, climate sciences and risk assessment.

The dissertation covers the topic of structural robustness of metabolic networks on the basis of the concept of elementary flux modes (EFMs). It is shown that the number of EFMs does not reflect the topology of a network sufficiently. Thus, new methods are developed to determine the structural robustness of metabolic networks. These methods are based on systematic in-silico knockouts and the subsequent calculation of dropped out EFMs. Thereby, together with single knockouts also double and multiple knockouts can be used. After evaluation of these methods they are applied to metabolic networks of human erythrocyte and hepatocyte as well as to a metabolic network of Escherichia coli (E. coli). It is found that the erythrocyte has the lowest structural robustness, followed by the hepatocyte and E. coli. These results coincide very well with the circumstance that human erythrocyte and hepatocyte and E. coli are able to adapt to conditions with increasing diversity. In a further part of the dissertation the concept of EFMs is expanded to signal transduction pathways consisting of kinase cascades. The concept of EFMs is based on the steady-state condition for metabolic pathways. It is shown that under certain circumstances this steady-state condition also holds for signalling cascades. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to deduce minimal conditions for signal transduction without knowledge about the kinetics involved. On the basis of these assumptions it is possible to calculate EFMs for signalling cascades. But due to the fact that these EFMs do no longer just have mass flux but also information flux, they are now called elementary signalling modes (ESMs).", "title_en": "Structural modelling and robustness analysis of complex metabolic networks and signal transduction cascades"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4038971-6", "gnd:4126481-2", "gnd:4185095-6", "gnd:4150934-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:36164-1; gnd:102244476X", "year": "2012", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

In this thesis, auditory models were applied to rehabilitative hearing devices in order to predict their expected benefit for the user. Rehabilitative hearing devices under test were (i) three different single-microphone noise reduction algorithms and (ii) a simulated cochlear implant. The first benefit was defined as the Acceptable Noise Level with a noise reduction algorithm in comparison to the situation without an algorithm. The influence of noise reduction algorithms on the Acceptable Noise Level could partly be predicted with the Oldenburg Perception Model for the averaged data from measurements with subjects. The second benefit was defined as the restored speech recognition performance for the Oldenburg sentence test with cochlear implants in dependence on pathologic peripheral changes of the auditory system as well as on different cognitive performance for the speech perception. From the model simulations with the cochlear implant model it was concluded that an individual prediction of the speech recognition performance might be possible with a precise estimation of the number and density of surviving auditory nerve cells together with the spatial spread function of the electric field as well as the cognitive speech recognition. <engl.> In dieser Doktorarbeit wurde die Eignung von auditorischen Modellen für die Vorhersage des Nutzens von rehabilitativen Hörhilfen untersucht.

Power-gating is the most promising run-time technique in order to reduce leakage currents in sub-100nm CMOS devices but its application is associated with numerous problems.

The soil living, Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is frequently exposed to a wide variety of stress and starvation conditions in its natural environment. In order to survive under these environmental and energy stresses, the bacterium acquired a general stress response mechanism mediated by the alternative sigma factor, SigB. A wide-variety of stress conditions such as environmental stress conditions like ethanol stress, heat stress, oxidative stress, osmotic stress or limitation of glucose, oxygen, phosphate etc.; and low temperature growth induce this SigB-dependent general stress response. Though much is known about the mechanisms of activation of this general stress response, the conditions that induce the SigB regulon and its general functions, the definition of the structure of the SigB regulon is not completely clear. The SigB-dependent general stress regulon has previously been characterized by proteomic approaches as well as DNA-array based expression studies. Genome-wide expression studies performed by Price, Petersohn and Helmann defined the SigB regulon containing well above 100 target genes, however the overlapping list of target genes contains only 67 members.

Homophile NCAM-Bindungen vermitteln Adhäsion zwischen Zellen und führen zu einer Aktivierung eines komplexen Netzes intrazellulärer Signalkaskaden. NCAM besitzt neben der extrazellulären Domäne, die aus fünf Ig-artigen Domänen und zwei membrannahen Fibronektin-Typ-III-homologen Domänen besteht, auch eine große cytoplasmatische Domäne. Diese cytoplasmatische Domäne spielt eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Signalweiterleitung und beim NCAM-induzierten Neuritenwachstum.

Obwohl bekannt ist, dass es beim NCAM-induzierten Neuritenwachstum zu einer verstärkten Phosphorylierung der cytoplasmatischen Domäne von NCAM kommt, war bisher nicht bekannt, welche der Phosphorylierungsstellen daran beteiligt sind. In dieser Arbeit wurde gezeigt, dass die potentielle Phosphorylierungsstelle an Serin 774 für das NCAM-vermittelte Neuritenwachstum und die Aktivierung des Transkriptionsfaktors CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein) notwendig ist.

It is implicated in various functions during development and maintenance of the nervous system. Homophilic NCAM binding mediates cell adhesion and leads to the activation of a complex network of intracellular signaling cascades. NCAM possesses an extracellular domain, which consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains and two fibronectin-type-III-domains. Apart from that NCAM also has a large intracellular domain, which plays an important role in signal transduction and during NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth. This cytoplasmic domain of NCAM contains, depending on the isoform, up to 49 potential phosphorylation sites. Although it is known that during the NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth the phosphorylation of the intracellular domain increases, it is not yet known which phosphorylation sites are involved. We have indentified that serine 774 of NCAM140 is necessary for NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth and activation of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein).

In this work, it was modeled properties of group-III nitrides and their alloys by means of ab initio methods.

The total energies and the optimized atomic geometries of all 22 clusters classes of the cluster expansion for each compound are calculated. The computationally demanding calculation of the corresponding quasiparticle electronic structures is achieved for all cluster classes by means of a recently developed scheme to approximately solve the quasiparticle equation based on the HSE06 hybrid functional and the G0W0 approach. Using two different alloy statistics, strict-regular solution model and microscopic decomposition model, the configurational averages are calculated. The composition-dependent electronic structures of the alloys are discussed based on configurationally averaged properties of the ground and excited states.

For successful integration into future devices, three major key challenges have to be faced: 1) the understanding of the fundamental properties, 2) the modification of the emission characteristics and 3) the investigation of the efficiency-limiting factors.", "title_en": "Lasing and ion beam doping of semiconductor nanowires"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4191263-9", "gnd:4218979-2", "gnd:4707308-1", "gnd:4027606-5", "gnd:4224496-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:36164-1; gnd:1033289213", "year": "2013", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

In this work a semi-automatic approach for the optimization of hardware architectures of safety-critical embedded systems is presented that supports developers in extending already existing systems with additional functionality given as software tasks. A two-tier optimization process explores the design space for valid allocations of the software tasks to the hardware architecture. The method exploits that large embedded systems typically are hierarchically composed of hardware subsystems: A global optimization step computes pre-allocations of all software tasks onto subsystems based on an abstract notion of the computation capacity. Separately for each subsystem, those tasks are then allocated to processors by local optimization steps such that they are schedulable and all constraints are satisfied. For both the global and the local optimization problem exact optimization methods bundled with experimental results are presented. <engl.> In dieser Arbeit wird ein teil-automatisiertes Verfahren zur Optimierung von sicherheitskritischen eingebetteten Systemen vorgestellt, das Entwickler bei der Erweiterung existierender Systeme um neue Funktionalität in Form von Softwaretasks unterstützt.

Zusammenfassung: The free energy landscape is a key quantity to represent and understand biomolecular processes like folding, molecular recognition and aggregation. While most experiments reveal structural properties of biomolecules, theoretical methods like molecular dynamics simulations additionally generate dynamical information at the microscopic level. Thanks to the development of optimized algorithms together with an increase in computational power, complex biomolecular processes can be directly simulated up to a time scale of microseconds. The studies in this thesis were motivated by a lack of proper methods to construct the free energy landscape for a speci c class of molecules, that is, nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA, and for a particular process, peptide aggregation. To study the energy landscape of nucleic acids, rst various kinds of collective variables are introduced. Internal coordinates are shown to give a better resolution of the energy landscape while keeping information about the intramolecular structure of the molecule. As an intriguing example, the analysis strategy is applied to the binding mechanism and speci city of a RNA riboswitch, i.e., a small molecule that can trigger gene expression. Finally, the focus is on peptide aggregation, a molecular mechanism of biomedical interest due to the relation between amyloid formation and degenerative between the di erent states occurring during the process, while keeping trace of the intramolecular and intermolecular information. Applied to several model systems, the new theoretical approaches and developments are shown to lead to a better microscopic understanding of complex biomolecular processes Zusammenfassung: La superficie di energia libera è una grandezza fondamentale per rappresentare e comprendere processi biomolecolari come il folding, il riconoscimento molecolare e l’aggregazione. Mentre la maggior parte degli esperimenti rivelano proprietà strutturali delle biomolecole, metodi teorici come simulazioni di dinamica molecolare generano informazioni dinamiche a livello microscopico. Grazie allo sviluppo di algoritmi ottimizzati insieme ad un aumento della potenza di calcolo, processi biomolecolari complessi possono essere direttamente simulati fino ad una scala temporale di microsecondi.Gli studi in questa tesi erano motivati da una mancanza di metodi adeguati per costruire la superficie di energia libera per una classe di molecole specifica, i.e., gli acidi nucleici come DNA e RNA, e per un particolare processo, i.e., l’aggregazione di peptidi. Per studiare la superficie di energia libera degli acidi nucleici, inizialmente sono introdotti vari tipi di variabili collettive. Coordinate interne si sono rivelate dare una migliore risoluzione della superficie di energia libera, mantenendo informazioni sulla struttura intramolecolare della molecola. Come esempio interessante, la strategia di analisi viene applicata al meccanismo di binding e la specificità di un RNA riboswitch, una piccola molecola che può attivare l'espressione genica. Infine, l'attenzione è rivolta all’aggregazione peptidica, un meccanismo molecolare di interesse biomedico a causa della relazione fra la formazione amiloide e malattie degenerative. Viene proposto un nuovo metodo che sia in grado di discriminare tra i diversi stati che si verificano durante il processo, mantenendo traccia delle informazioni intramolecolare e intermolecolare.

Neben therapeutisch erforderlichen Ernährungsmaßnahmen und dauerhafter Gewichtsreduktion, werden eine optimale Makronährstoffzusammensetzung und mögliche protektive Wirkungen, zum Beispiel der alpha-Linolensäure (ALA), diskutiert. Daher wurde eine sechsmonatige kontrollierte Ernährungsstudie bei MBS-Patienten mit dem Ziel durchgeführt, die Effekte eines neuen hypoenergetischen Ernährungskonzeptes auf Körpergewicht und Risikoprofil sowie mögliche Wirkungen einer erhöhten ALA-Zufuhr zu untersuchen.

The metabolic syndrome (MBS) is influenced by overeating, lack of exercise and raised cardiovascular risk. Improved nutritional habits and an enduring weight reduction are essential for therapy. However, the optimal macronutrient composition and metabolically favourable food components, such as alpha-linolenic acid, are still a matter of debate. We investigated the effects of a hypoenergetic diet over six month in patients with the MBS on body weight and risk profile as well as possible effects of an increased ALA-intake. The latter was realised by comparison of rapeseed oil and olive oil in two intervention groups. After intervention, body weight, blood pressure and parameters of lipid and endothelial metabolism as well as prevalence of the metabolic syndrome were significantly reduced. Differences between groups were investigated for significantly more declined diastolic blood pressure, concentrations of serum TAG as well as YKL-40 after rapeseed oil diet. This could indicate an individual effect of ALA.

This thesis is dedicated to the release and immobilization of As5+ and Sb5+ in contaminated geomaterials. Although the physical properties and chemical composition of the contaminated materials vary widely, the mechanisms, which control the fate of the contaminants are supposedly similar. In order to understand these mechanisms, I carried out a mineralogical and geochemical investigation of a soil, which was mixed with contaminated As-rich ash waste. With techniques including powder-PXRD, ICP-MS, sequential extractions, EMPA and synchrotron based µ-XRD and XANES, the carriers of As5+ in the fresh ash waste and soil-ash mixtures were identified and characterized. Glass particles and unburned coal particles with veinlets of As-rich calcite are the main carriers of As5+. In the soil-ash mixtures, the soluble As5+ containing phases of the ash-waste almost completely disappeared and As5+ migrated into the soil components, presumably consisting of iron oxides. In the following study, the immobilization of As5+ by iron oxides in the context of As5+ incorporation in hematite was investigated. As5+-ferrihydrite was transformed to hematite and examined by ICP-MS, powder-XRD, SEM, TEM, and EXAFS spectroscopy. The results show that As5+ can be incorporated into hematite with concentrations of 1.9 wt%. This novel immobilization mechanism encouraged me to investigate the possibility of Sb5+ incorporation into iron oxides in a subsequent study. Ferrihydrite was doped with different concentrations of Sb5+, As5+, and P5+ and transformed to more-well crystalline products. The transformation products were analyzed and characterized by ICP-MS, PXRD, SEM and TEM. The results show that Sb5+ directly controls the outcome of the ferrihydrite transformation and therefore the transformation products. These transformation products contain Sb5+ with up to 14 wt.%, exceeding an exclusive adsorption mechanism by far, suggesting structural incorporation of Sb5+ into the iron oxides.", "title_en": "Arsenic and antimony in the environment : release and possible immobilization mechanisms"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4188107-2", "gnd:4206275-5", "gnd:4143104-2", "gnd:4480680-2", "gnd:4142712-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:36164-1; gnd:1045006378", "year": "2013", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Next to its well-established anti-bacterial properties, plasma can have lethal as well as stimulating effects on mammalian cells. Therefore, the medical application of non-thermal plasma on chronic wounds seems to be a promising tool to enable healing processes.

Alkali-silica reaction causes major problems in concrete structures due to the rapidity of its deformation which leads to the serviceability limit of the structure being reached well before its time. Factors that affect ASR vary greatly, including alkali and silica content, relative humidity, temperature and porosity of the cementitious matrix,all these making it a very complex phenomenon to consider explicitly. With this in mind, the finite element technique was used to build models and generate expansive pressures and damage propagation due to ASR under the influence of thermo-hygrochemoelastic loading. Since ASR initializes in the mesoscopic regions of the concrete, the accumulative effects of its expansion escalates onto the macroscale level with the development of web cracking on the concrete surface, hence solution of the damage model as well as simulation of the ASR phenomenon at both the macroscale and mesoscale levels have been performed. The macroscale model realizes the effects of ASR expansion as a whole and shows how it develops under the influence of moisture, thermal and mechanical loading. Results of the macroscale modeling are smeared throughout the structure and are sufficient to show how damage due to ASR expansion orientates. As opposed to the mesoscale model, the heterogeneity of the model shows us how difference in material properties between aggregates and the cementitious matrix facilitates ASR expansion. With both these models, the ASR phenomenon under influence of thermo-chemo-hygro-mechanical loading can be better understood.", "title_en": "Numerical simulation of thermo-chemo-hygro-mechanical alkali-silica reaction model in concrete at the mesoscale and macroscale"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4126904-4", "gnd:7684670-2", "gnd:4196812-8", "gnd:7651795-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Itam, Zarina", "year": "2014", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Printing technologies for the fabrication of electronic components have emerged in recent years and have attracted interest due to their capabilities of cost-effective material deposition and their suitability for large-area coatings. In this thesis, the benefits of inkjet printing technologies are used to manufacture piezoelectric actuators that are suitable for integration in polymer-based, disposable microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Based on analytical models of actuator behavior, piezoelectric actuators with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) as the active material are inkjet printed and characterized in detail for the first time here. The thermal treatment applied to the P(VDF-TrFE) films exhibits a significant influence on device performance and morphology. Annealing at temperatures between 110 and 140 °C yields distinct piezoelectric behavior. These findings are employed to demonstrate the function of a membrane pump with an inkjet printed actuator with pump rates up to 130 µL/min, which is suitable for applications in LOC systems. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the manufacturing approach introduced here as well as the established knowledge about the behavior of inkjet printed P(VDF-TrFE) actuators are novel. The low processing temperatures and the use of digital printing technologies lead to cost-effective processing compared to conventional, lithography- and vacuum-based manufacturing approaches. Different from most current micropumps, an additional assembly step is not required, which would be necessary when an actuator is manufactured separately and then attached to the pump membrane. Furthermore, the manufacturing approach and design introduced here are compatible with processes and materials that are used in LOC systems.

Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy (SNOM) is a powerful and widely-used method in nano- and micro-optics. In aperture SNOM, a dielectric tip with an opaque coating featuring a sub-wavelength aperture at the tip apex is used either to locally illuminate the sample under investigation, or to map the sample’s optical near-fields. In contrast to classical microscopy, SNOM provides access to the evanescent fields at the sample surface and is thus able to break the diffraction limit. In this thesis, several new near-field characterization methods were developed: By combining two SNOMs with fiber tips into a Dual-SNOM setup, samples can be near-field illuminated at a freely chosen position by the first tip, while the second tip scans the sample surface and maps the optical near-fields, thus giving access to the near-field Green’s function. The Dual-SNOM was used for polarization-selective mapping of plasmonic aperture emission and for the investigation of plasmonic modes in metal strip waveguides. Furthermore, two single-tip techniques were developed and were applied to map whispering-gallery modes (WGM) in fused silica microdisk resonators. In scanning thermocouple-probe microscopy, the sample surface is scanned by a miniature thermocouple tip, which is heated by optical absorption and thus converts the optical signal into an electrical signal directly at the measurement location. In the second mapping method for WGM, a sharp, fully metal-coated fiber tip is used as a scatterer whose position influences the resonance positions and the coupling between WGMs and their respective counter-propagating, degenerate modes. Consequently, the transmission and reflection that can be measured at the ends of the tapered fiber loop which serves for excitation of the WGMs are also modified by the tip’s presence. By correlating the transmission and reflection signals with the tip’s position, highly resolved images were obtained. As an application example of aperture SNOM, near-field mapping of non-broadening plasmonic Airy beams and of plasmonic hot-spots generated by interference of two such beams is demonstrated.", "title_en": "Scanning near-field optical microscopy : from single-tip to dual-tip operation"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4174845-1", "gnd:4380320-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1072082616", "year": "2014", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A830342885", "content": {"text": "Applications of Bayesian networks in natural hazard assessments. Even though quite different in occurrence and consequences, from a modeling perspective many natural hazards share similar properties and challenges. Their complex nature as well as lacking knowledge about their driving forces and potential effects make their analysis demanding: uncertainty about the modeling framework, inaccurate or incomplete event observations and the intrinsic randomness of the natural phenomenon add up to different interacting layers of uncertainty, which require a careful handling. Nevertheless deterministic approaches are still widely used in natural hazard assessments, holding the risk of underestimating the hazard with disastrous effects. The all-round probabilistic framework of Bayesian networks constitutes an attractive alternative. In contrast to deterministic proceedings, it treats response variables as well as explanatory variables as random variables making no difference between input and output variables. Using a graphical representation Bayesian networks encode the dependency relations between the variables in a directed acyclic graph: variables are represented as nodes and (in-)dependencies between variables as (missing) edges between the nodes. The joint distribution of all variables can thus be described by decomposing it, according to the depicted independences, into a product of local conditional probability distributions, which are defined by the parameters of the Bayesian network. In the framework of this thesis the Bayesian network approach is applied to different natural hazard domains (i.e. seismic hazard, flood damage and landslide assessments). Learning the network structure and parameters from data, Bayesian networks reveal relevant dependency relations between the included variables and help to gain knowledge about the underlying processes. The problem of Bayesian network learning is cast in a Bayesian framework, considering the network structure and parameters as random variables itself and searching for the most likely combination of both, which corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP score) of their joint distribution given the observed data. Although well studied in theory the learning of Bayesian networks based on real-world data is usually not straight forward and requires an adoption of existing algorithms. Typically arising problems are the handling of continuous variables, incomplete observations and the interaction of both. Working with continuous distributions requires assumptions about the allowed families of distributions. To \"let the data speak\" and avoid wrong assumptions, continuous variables are instead discretized here, thus allowing for a completely data-driven and distribution-free learning. An extension of the MAP score, considering the discretization as random variable as well, is developed for an automatic multivariate discretization, that takes interactions between the variables into account. The discretization process is nested into the network learning and requires several iterations. Having to face incomplete observations on top, this may pose a computational burden. Iterative proceedings for missing value estimation become quickly infeasible. A more efficient albeit approximate method is used instead, estimating the missing values based only on the observations of variables directly interacting with the missing variable. Moreover natural hazard assessments often have a primary interest in a certain target variable. The discretization learned for this variable does not always have the required resolution for a good prediction performance. Finer resolutions for (conditional) continuous distributions are achieved with continuous approximations subsequent to the Bayesian network learning, using kernel density estimations or mixtures of truncated exponential functions. All our proceedings are completely data-driven. We thus avoid assumptions that require expert knowledge and instead provide domain independent solutions, that are applicable not only in other natural hazard assessments, but in a variety of domains struggling with uncertainties.", "title_en": "Applications of Bayesian networks in natural hazard assessments"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4123823-0", "gnd:4137042-9", "gnd:4567228-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:2120681-8; gnd:1074045890", "year": "2013", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Zusammenfassung: This thesis considers so-called qualitative constraint-based reasoning: qualitative information is formalized and posed as constraints to entities. Algorithms process these constraints to decide the satisfiability of the description. This approach has often been formalized by means of relation algebras, which has led to the definition of qualitative constraint calculi. In contrast, I consider the reasoning problem in the context of constraint programming. To this end, I compare the relation-algebraic approach to established alternative formalisms, such as constraint languages and first-order logic. The results illustrate shortcomings in previous work and show that a more flexible approach by means of constraint languages can be used to substitute the relation-algebraic view. Further, previously used \"qualitative techniques\" are compared with established generic algorithms from constraint programming. This results in an implementation of a solver, called GQR, which combines techniques from both sides to provide improved qualitative constraint-based reasoning.To further illustrate the difference between qualitative constraint calculi and constraint programming, I formulate several popular examples of such calculi - the Point and Interval Algebra, as well as RCC8 - in the form of improved representations with dedicated sets of logic rules. The relation-algebraic approach can also be understood in this way, such that a comparison is possible. Both theoretical study and empirical evaluation show that efficient approaches are in particular those representations with sets of rule that are capable of solving large fragments of the language in polynomial time. Moreover, this research shows properties of previous approaches by means of propositional satisfiability.Next, qualitative spatio-temporal constraint problems are studied. As these have been solved with constraint programming before, I theoretically formulate the problem for the Point Algebra. An analysis shows that most fragments of the spatio-temporal language have an associated NP-complete satisfiability problem - despite the fact that constraint problems of the simple Point Algebra are polynomial time. I also briefly present an application of this formalism to robot motion planning.Finally, I consider reasoning problems in the context of qualitative route descriptions. The main focus here is to derive computational complexity results for generating and evaluating such descriptions on a g ... Zusammenfassung: Die vorliegende Arbeit behandelt das sogenannte qualitative Schließen mittels Constraint-basierten Methoden. Dabei werden qualitative Informationen in Form von Einschränkungen (Constraints) an Objekte formuliert und durch Algorithmen untereinander in Bezug gesetzt um Aussagen über die Realisierbarkeit der Beschreibung zu erhalten. Klassischerweise wurden solche Ansätze oft auf der Basis von Relationenalgebren formalisiert. Diese Problemauffassung bildet insbesondere die Grundlage für die oft zitiert und verwendete Definition von qualitativen Constraint-Kalkülen.Diese Dissertation stützt sich größtenteils auf den Ansatz der Constraintprogrammierung, in der verschiedene Arten von Constraints miteinander verbunden und durch spezifische oder generische Algorithmen verarbeitetet werden. Dabei tritt inbesondere der eigentliche relationenalgebraische Ansatz in den Hintergrund, da die Art der Constraints und deren Verarbeitung deutlich freier gewählt werden kann. Zu diesem Zweck wird hier ein Vergleich des relationenalgebraischen Ansatzes zu den alternativen Formalismen, Constraint-Sprachen und Prädikatenlogik erster Stufe, gezogen. Dieser Vergleich liefert auch direkt die Erkenntnisse, dass ein sehr ähnlicher, aber deutlich generellerer, Ansatz auch mittels Constraint-Sprachen möglich ist und eine frühere Aussage über Eigenschaften qualitativer Constraint-Kalküle fehlerhaft ist.

Zusammenfassung: Energy harvesting systems are electronic systems which harvest the needed energy from the ambiance and which are thus self-sufficient. Such systems find application in rather remote outdoor areas (e.g. in forests) or indoors. In both application scenarios, the available illumination densities are two to three orders of magnitude below the given illumination densities in standard photovoltaic applications. Therefore, the solar cell behavior under low illumination densities (0.1 mW/cm² to 10 mW/cm²) and underartificial light sources is of importance for the application of solar cells in energy harvesting systems. Within this work, the current state of the art for solar cells in indoorand low light applications is presented with the focus on solar cell characterization and optimization.

Making the interaction of human subjects with technical systems more intuitive is a quickly emerging interdisciplinary field of research. One important aspect of this field is the surveillance of the user by the respective system and thus enabling it to estimate distinct user states. The automatic recognition of user states in human-computer interaction poses a great challenge to statistical pattern recognition for several reasons: The measurements of the different sensors are inherently heterogeneous in their technical properties, for example considering sample rates, range of values or resolution. Another important aspect is the fact that the true state of a subject is generally not entirely observable from the outside, which makes the design of corpora that study human-computer interaction extremely difficult. This leads in many cases to weakly or subjectively defined class labels by either using human test persons that annotate the collected material manually or by using externally triggered stimuli that are designed to elicit distinct predefined states. In order to approach the recognition of user states in human-computer interaction, the multi-modal and the temporal properties of the application are exploited in this work. For this purpose, different information fusion architectures based on multiple classifier system approaches and temporal integration techniques are introduced and discussed. Besides this, the incorporation of unlabeled data into the training of the classifier is a compelling issue since one is generally short of training data as described earlier. This work will introduce a partially supervised learning approach, that combines unsupervised and supervised learning in order to extend the amount of usable data. Finally, the problem of imbalanced class distributions is tackled by a class weighting mechanism in the training of support vector machines, which increases the loss for the underrepresented class.", "title_en": "Multiple classifier systems in human-computer interaction"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4193754-5", "gnd:4125909-9", "gnd:4784306-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1076804861", "year": "2015", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is a global problem that has to be understood in the context of a globalising world with an increasing amount of goods being traded. This dissertation focuses on the interrelation between international trade and climate policies. It contributes to the literature from two perspectives: a demand side view by means of theoretical modelling, and a supply side view using numerical simulation. The first part of this dissertation uses general equilibrium trade models to analyse the effect of trade liberalisation on the environment. It shows that a trade-induced reallocation of production factors towards the most productive firms can explain part of sector-level changes in emission intensities. Moreover, if environmental policy is used strategically to substitute for trade policy, general equilibrium effects on firms’ markups need to be considered. The findings highlight that firm behaviour, factor reallocation across firms, and market structure all play a vital role for the impact of trade on the environment. The second part of this dissertation turns to the supply side of fossil fuels—the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It shows that fossil fuels are globally abundant despite uncertainties in local supply, for instance of unconventional natural gas. It is hence not a physical scarcity that solves the problem of climate change. Accordingly, climate policy has to target the use of fossil fuels. While the use of natural gas may be consistent with the transformation towards a low carbon energy system, the phase-out of coal is integral for climate change mitigation. By means of numerical simulations, the relation between climate policy and the international trade in natural gas and steam coal is investigated. Moreover, this dissertation analyses to what extent major steam coal exporters have a self-interest in restricting their supply.", "title_en": "Trade and climate policies : the role of market structure, strategic behaviour, and the supply side of carbon"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:7547705-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1025020073", "year": "2015", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Zusammenfassung: The occurrence of the sweet chestnut in the form of grown coppices in the foothill zone of the Vosges, the Palatine woods and the Black Forest is due to a long winegrowing tradition in the Upper Rhine region. During the principal winegrowing period, sweet chestnut coppices delivered high quality vineyard poles and were an indispensable source of wood and nourishment for rural populations. In the last decades however, forests have gradually lost their significance as a production site for society at large. This tendency is also reflected by the sweet chestnut forest stands. The existing coppice stands were either converted into timber producing forests or abandoned. The once graded transition from the open land to timber forests, which was originally created by sweet chestnut coppice stands along the timber line, was slowly transformed into simply structured farm land alongside timber forests characterized by viniculture.This thesis is part of the EU-funded project „The sweet chestnut in the Upper Rhine region – A tree species which connects people, cultures and landscapes“. The research tasks of the Chair of Landscape Management were to determine the touristic and sociocultural impact of this tree species. In particular, the objective of the thesis was to investigate the aesthetic importance of the sweet chestnut in the Upper Rhine region. The studies intended to demonstrate why traditional cultivation methods of the sweet chestnut should be preserved, especially in consideration of the ever increasing homogenization of the landscape. To answer this research question, it was first necessary to develop a suitable procedure for evaluating the aesthetic impact of specific tree species on the landscape. The challenge of this thesis was to approachthe simple, yet by its nature strongly subjective question regarding the „beauty“ of specific tree species in the landscape from an application-oriented perspective (i.e., as objectively as possible).Starting from various methods of image-based landscape assessment and empirical social research, analytical steps specifically tailored to the research question were developed. These steps made it possible to approach the problem from both a userdependent as well as a user-independent point of view. Combining several methods of landscape assessment in order to gradually analyze the impact of the sweet chestnut, or any other specific tree species on a given part of the landscape, allowed taking i ...", "title_en": "Kulturelle und ästhetische Wahrnehmung der Edelkastanie am Oberrhein : ein experimentelles Verfahren zur landschaftsästhetischen Bewertung von Baumarten am Beispiel von Castanea sativa Mill."}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4299983-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1077018827", "year": "2015", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "de"}}

The study was motivated by the initially scarce knowledge about pastoralism in Azerbaijan and concerns about declining pasture condition due to growing livestock numbers. The study was guided by three research objectives, which were addressed cumulatively in five publications. The first objective aims at analysing the development of pastoralism in the transition period in comparison to developments in the pastoral sectors of other post-socialist countries. Secondly, the study addresses socio-economic causes of inappropriate pasture management by pastoralists. Finally, in an application-oriented research process recommendations for improving the management of pastoral farms and pasture governance were developed in order to mitigate inappropriate pasture management. For addressing these objectives the study frames the management of rangelands as a complex natural resource management system, in which the environment, users, governance structures, and the socio-political context are closely linked.

Sample supervised search centric image segmentation denotes a general method where quality segments are generated based on the provision of a selection of reference segments. The main purpose of such a method is to correctly segment a multitude of identical elements in an image based on these reference segments. An efficient search algorithm traverses the parameter space of a given segmentation algorithm. A supervised quality measure guides the search for the best segmentation results, or rather the best performing parameter set. This method, which is academically pursued in the context of remote sensing and elsewhere, shows promise in assisting the generation of earth observation information products. The method may find applications specifically within the context of user driven geographic object-based image analysis approaches, mainly in respect of very high resolution optical data. Rapid mapping activities as well as general land-cover mapping or targeted element identification may benefit from such a method. In this work it is suggested that sample supervised search centric geographic segment generation forms the basis of a set of methods, or rather a methodological avenue. The original formulation of the method, although promising, is limited in the quality of the segments it can produce – it is still limited by the inherent capability of the given segmentation algorithm. From an optimisation viewpoint, various structures may be encoded forming the fitness or search landscape traversed by a given search algorithm. These structures may interact or have an interplay with the given segmentation algorithm. Various method variants considering expanded fitness landscapes are possible. Additional processes, or constituents, such as data mapping, classification and post-segmentation heuristics may be embedded into such a method.

We study segregation of the subducted oceanic crust (OC) at the core mantle boundary and its ability to accumulate and form large thermochemical piles (such as the seismically observed Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces - LLSVPs). Our high-resolution numerical simulations suggest that the longevity of LLSVPs for up to three billion years, and possibly longer, can be ensured by a balance in the rate of segregation of high-density OC-material to the CMB, and the rate of its entrainment away from the CMB by mantle upwellings. For a range of parameters tested in this study, a large-scale compositional anomaly forms at the CMB, similar in shape and size to the LLSVPs. Neutrally buoyant thermochemical piles formed by mechanical stirring - where thermally induced negative density anomaly is balanced by the presence of a fraction of dense anomalous material - best resemble the geometry of LLSVPs. Such neutrally buoyant piles tend to emerge and survive for at least 3Gyr in simulations with quite different parameters. We conclude that for a plausible range of values of density anomaly of OC material in the lower mantle - it is likely that it segregates to the CMB, gets mechanically mixed with the ambient material, and forms neutrally buoyant large scale compositional anomalies similar in shape to the LLSVPs.

The main focus of the present thesis was to investigate the stabilization ability of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) in several examples as well as develop novel chemical structures and synthetic routes of PILs. The performed research can be specifically divided into three parts that include synthesis and application of hybrid material composed of PIL and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), thiazolium-containing PILs, and main-chain imidazolium-type PILs. In the first chapter, a vinylimidazolium-type IL was polymerized in water in the presence of CNFs resulting in the in situ electrostatic grafting of polymeric chains onto the surface of CNFs. The synthesized hybrid material merged advantages of its two components, that is, superior mechanical strength of CNFs and anion dependent solution properties of PILs. In contrast to unmodified CNFs, the hybrid could be stabilized and processed in organic solvents enabling its application as reinforcing agent for porous polyelectrolyte membranes. In the second part, PILs and ionic polymers containing two types of thiazolium repeating units were synthesized. Such polymers displayed counterion dependent thermal stability and solubility in organic solvents of various dielectric constants. This new class of PILs was tested as stabilizers and phase transfer agents for carbon nanotubes in aqueous and organic media, and as binder materials to disperse electroactive powders and carbon additives in solid electrode in lithium-ion batteries. The incorporation of S and N atoms into the polymeric structures make such PILs also potential precursors for S, N - co-doped carbons. In the last chapter, reactants originating from biomass were successfully harnessed to synthesize main-chain imidazolium-type PILs. An imidazolium-type diester IL obtained via a modified Debus-Radziszewski reaction underwent transesterification with diol in a polycondensation reaction. This yielded a polyester-type PIL which CO2 sorption properties were investigated. In the next step, the modified Debus-Radziszewski reaction was further applied to synthesize main-chain PILs according to a convenient, one-step protocol, using water as a green solvent and simple organic molecules as reagents. Depending on the structure of the employed diamine, the synthesized PILs after anion exchange showed superior thermal stability with unusually high carbonization yields. Overall, the outcome of these studies will actively contribute to the current research on PILs by introducing novel PIL chemical structures, improved synthetic routes, and new examples of stabilized materials.

Zusammenfassung: The analysis of nucleic acids is an essential pre-requisite for initialisation of evidence based therapy of many genetic, inherited or infectious diseases in which the presentation of the clinical symptoms is non-specific or certain sequence patterns on the nucleic acid strand are associated with a pathological indication. Compared to conventional culture based methods, nucleic acid analysis provides an obvious benefit in specificity and reduction in time-to-result. In time-critical situations and in settings where access to centralized labora-tories for sample analysis is limited, nucleic acid analysis, conducted directly at the “point-of-care” would be desired. However, the complex workflow for analysis, typically comprising cell lysis, nucleic acid purification, amplification and detection, hinders the automation in portable systems and consequently only few point-of-care systems are available.Aim of this thesis was the development of a centrifugal microfluidic cartridge for nucleic acid analysis that potentially could be operated at the point-of-care. To achieve this goal, several sub-goals including the development of a process chains for nucleic acid extraction and for multiplex nucleic acid amplification were defined. These process chains were finally co-integrated on one cartridge for sample-to-answer nucleic acid analysis.Initially, a unit operation for transportation of magnetic beads between several microfluidic chambers was developed. Here, bead transport was solely depending on the azimuthal position of the cartridge with respect to a locally fixed, external permanent magnet, ‘transport magnet’. This implementation allowed an isoradial arrangement of the microfluidic chambers thereby circumventing one of the basic limitations for integration of complex assays on the centrifugal microfluidic cartridge: the arrangement of consequtive assay steps in radial direction from the cartridge center towards the rim. Yield of bead transport through three microfluidic chambers was measured to 82.6 % ± 3.6 %. With this unit operation, DNA from Listeria innocua lysates and lambda phages was purified with recoveries of up to 68 % ± 24 % and 43 % ± 10 %, respectively, compared to manual reference. The unit-operation was then completed by a second external permanent magnet, ‘collection magnet’, to collect beads in liquid volumes as large as 1 mL before they are transported out of the liquid into the adjacent microfluidic chamber ... Zusammenfassung: Die Analyse von Nukleinsäuresequenzen ist die Grundlage für die Einleitung von evidenzbasierten Therapien vieler infektions-, genetisch und erblich bedingter Krankheiten insbesondere wenn sich diese durch eine unspezifische Symptomatik präsentieren oder Sequenzmuster auf dem Nukleinsäurestrang mit einem pathogenen Befund assozziert sein können. Konventionellen, kulturbasierten Verfahren ist die Nukleinsäureanalytik vor allem durch eine höhere Spezifizität und eine geringere Analysezeit überlegen. Für zeitkritische Fragestellungen und in Umgebungen, in denen kein Zugang zu einer zentrallabor-basierten Diagnostik besteht, wäre eine Durchführung der Analyse am sogenannten Point-of-Care wünschenswert. Die Vielzahl der erforderlichen Einzelschritten wie Zelllyse, Nukleinsäureaufreinigung, Amplifikation und Detektion, erschwert jedoch eine Automatisierung der Analyse erheblich. Aus diesem Grund sind erst wenige Point-of-Care Systeme am Markt verfügbar. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Entwicklung einer zentrifugal-mikrofluidischen Kartusche für die Nukleinsäureanalytik die potentiell am Point-of-Care eingesetzt werden kann. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen wurden mehrere Teilziele einschließlich der Entwicklung von zentrifugal-mikrofluidischen Prozessketten zur Nukleinsäureextraktion und Amplifikation definiert. Anschließend wurden die entwickelten Prozessketten gemeinsam in eine Kartusche integriert um den vollständigen Ablauf der Analyse von der Probenaufgabe bis zum Ergebnis automatisiert abzubilden.

Moreover, microglia-specific deletion of Tgfb1 (mgTgfb1-/-) was induced to address the effects of microglia-derived TGFβ1. According to the current literature, this is the first study using mouse lines with microglia-specific knockout of TGFβ signalling molecules.I could show that the generated mouse lines are valid models for the microglia-specific analysis of TGFβ signalling, as demonstrated by deletion on genomic and protein levels. Importantly, functional impairment of TGFβ signalling could be detected in vitro and in vivo. The knockout mice were used to reveal that microglial TGFβ signalling is not essential for microglia survival and maintenance, as no differences were seen in microglia cell numbers in vivo. Elevated cell numbers in vitro indicated an increased proliferative activity of mgTgfbr2-/- microglia. Furthermore, mice did not show any phenotypic differences with regard to body weight or survival. Additionally, using mgSmad4-/- mice, I could show that the expression of distinct TGFβ-induced genes was dependent on SMAD4. Interestingly, TGFβ-driven nuclear translocation of R-SMADs in microglia was independent on SMAD4.I could show that knockout of microglial Tgfbr2, but not of Smad4 or Tgfb1, led to an activated microglia phenotype under physiological conditions as reflected by increased expression activation markers CD86, CD206, CD36 and MHCII. mgTgfbr2-/- microglia also showed an increase of TAK1 phosphorylation as well as CCL2 and CXCL10 secretion. In contrast, knockout of Smad4 only led to a moderate increase of TAK1 phosphorylation and secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 in vitro. I could therefore show that the effects mgTgfbr2 and mgSmad4 knockout resulted in different outcome, indicating a major role of R-SMAD-dependent signalling in the regulation of microglia activation under physiological conditions. However, distinct and partially non-overlapping effects were detected in mgSmad4-/- microglia, indicating a contribution of Co-SMAD-dependent signalling for microglia quiescence. Exogenous TGFβ1 was no longer able to attenuate IFNγ-induced upregulation of the activation markers iNos and Tnfa in Tgfbr2 ...", "title_en": "Characterisation of microglia-specific Tgfbr2, Smad4 and Tgfb1 knockout mice"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4671699-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1079427147", "year": "2016", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

The present work investigates the responses of plants to abiotic environmental conditions and their effects on ecosystem properties. It builds on the notion of the effect-response framework. Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania served as a model system, where plant functional traits of the most abundant and widespread species were collected. The main part of this dissertation consists of three chapters to be published as research articles. The first of the main chapters investigates the niche breadths of plant species along environmental gradients and addresses the question whether plant functional traits can predict corresponding niche optima. The second study deals with the variance of trait values within and between plant communities in relation to environmental conditions. In the third main chapter, it is investigated whether plant functional traits, the abiotic environment, or both combined influence mean animal body mass in taxonomically defined groups or feeding guilds. <engl.> Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht die Wirkung abiotischer Umweltfaktoren auf Pflanzen und deren Einfluss auf Ökosystemeigenschaften.

Accelerated permafrost thaw under the warming Arctic climate can have a significant impact on Arctic landscapes. Areas underlain by permafrost store high amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC).

Coastal erosion, amplified through a decrease in Arctic sea-ice extent, may also mobilise SOC from permafrost.

Zusammenfassung: For plants as sessile organisms the acclimatisation to environmental fluctuations is the most essential, critical and at the same time challenging process to evolve plasticity (Smith, 1982, 2000). Such acclimatisation processes require refined sensitive mechanisms, including a variety of different light sensing photoreceptors (Smith, 1982; Montgomery and Lagarias, 2002). Phytochromes are the most important photoreceptors in plants regulating several essential developmental changes like seed germination and de-etiolation as well as stem elongation (Figure 1.1). However, the two major phytochromes phyA and phyB exhibit dramatic differences in their action spectra for physiological responses, with phyB being most active in red light and phyA in far red light (Casal et al., 1998).

Research of solute transport fundamentally contributes to our understanding of soil functions as most processes in soils are dynamically driven and related to the transient conditions produced by the transport of solutes. For this reason, especially the transport of contaminants is frequently studied with laboratory scale column outflow experiments in an open-flow mode. This thesis presents a complementary approach of conducting saturated column experiments that is characterized by the recirculation of the effluent into the inflow via a mixing vessel and is therefore referred to as closed-flow mode column experiment. Depending on the ratio of the volume of the mixing vessel and the water-filled pore space, a damped oscillating concentration emerges in the effluent and in the mixing vessel. Oscillation frequency, damping and amplitude are thereby governed by the properties of the porous medium and the target substance. It was shown by column experiments with quartz sand that the appearance of oscillations can be controlled by using different mixing vessel solute volumes. The breakthrough data obtained within these experiments was then used to validate a numerical model that was derived by coupling the numerical solution of a transport equation with the model describing the mixing vessel in a loop. This model was used for a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to illustrate the response of the breakthrough curve to changes in the dispersion and the parameters describing adsorption with respect to strength, rate and nonlinearity. Each process thereby produced unique responses that confirm the high information content of closed-flow breakthrough data, which has shown to intrinsically contain information on the water content and the pumping rate as well. Finally, a numerical analysis of inverse parameter determination revealed a massive decrease in parameter uncertainty under optimal conditions, which renders the approach also highly relevant for practical applications.", "title_en": "Experimental and theoretical analysis of closed-flow column experiments : an alternative approach for the investigation of solute transport on the continuum scale"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4185932-7", "gnd:4015999-1", "gnd:4156462-5", "gnd:4432839-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:36164-1; gnd:111566784X", "year": "2016", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

This work covers electron positron pair production in spatially homogeneous electric (and magnetic) fields. Different field configurations are looked at in order to study various phenomena including multiphoton pair production, Sauter-Schwinger pair production and dynamically assisted pair production. The main focus lies on pulsed, rotating fields with one main frequency component which are called rotating Sauter pulses. The results are obtained via different numerical methods, that rest on different theoretical approaches. A generic method is derived from the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism which entails a modified quantum kinetic equation. We call the numerical solution of this equation the Wigner method. Other types of equations are derived from the DHW formalism as well and numerically solved with the aim to include magnetic fields. In the case of rotating Sauter pulses a completely different numerical method is developed, which is based on a semiclassical approach and therefore called the semiclassical method. A number of parameter studies are conducted to understand pair production in these rotating Sauter pulses. In those studies the Wigner method and the semiclassical method are compared exhaustively and found to complement each other. This makes it possible to cover the complete range of parameters of the rotating Sauter pulse, which helps to calculate the pair production rates for experiments involving counter-propagating circularly polarized laser light. An interpretation of the resulting pair production spectra is given. Due to the general nature of the Wigner method it is possible to study more general field configurations which include pulses with elliptic polarization, chirped pulses or bichromatic rotating Sauter pulses.

The heterogeneous physicochemical properties of biofilm and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play an important role in deciding the fate of transport of nanoparticles in subsurface. However, contrasting results have been observed for the mobility of different nanoparticle transport in porous media coated with biofilms. Also, no comparative studies ave been done linking the effect of biofilms on colloidal stability and mobility of colloids to date. Laboratory scale experiments were conducted to obtain insights into different ways bacterial biofilms and EPS can influence the transport of nanoparticles in porous media. Using complementary experimental approaches, we investigated (1) the effect of microbial EPS on the colloidal stability of nanoparticles, (2a.) the transport of uncoated colloidal nanoparticles in biofilm and EPS-coated porous media, (2b.) the transport of EPS-coated colloidal nanoparticles in uncoated porous media (2c), the combined transport of EPS-coated colloids in biofilm and EPS-coated porous media, and finally (3) the remobilization of deposited colloidal nanoparticles by EPS. Laboratory synthesized hematite nanoparticles (HNP) and Bacillus subtilis 168 (DSM 402) were used as nanoparticles and biofilm forming bacterium respectively. To study the effect of EPS on the colloidal stability, HNP were amended with three increasing concentrations of EPS (20, 200 and 500 mg/l carbon) resulting in carbon:iron ratios 1:5, 2:1 and 5:1, respectively. The zeta potential (ZP), the shift in isoelectric point and the change in the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) for NaCl and CaCl2 showed formation of colloidally stable organo-mineral colloids at higher concentrations of EPS (200 mg/l and 500 mg/l of carbon, HNP2:1, HNP 5:1). However, lower concentrations of EPS (20 mg/l carbon, HNP 1:5) resulted into aggregation of HNP. The transport of uncoated and EPS-coated HNP colloids at environmental pH was studied with closed flow columns experiments in three different synthetic porous media, i.e., uncoated, biofilm-coated, and EPS-coated glass beads. No drastic change was observed in the pH and the electrical conductivity of the system during the transport experiments. However, a constant amount of organic matter and bacterial cells were continuously released from the porous media coatings. In the first scenario, positively charged uncoated HNP were immobile and retained in uncoated-glass bead porous media.

Symbiosis is ubiquitous in nature and can play a crucial role in shaping the biology of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Importantly, the interaction of microorganisms with eukaryotes can range from pathogenicity to mutualism, also shifting along this continuum. The ecological settings facilitating such lifestyle transitions are, however, poorly understood. This dissertation focuses on the symbiosis between Lagriinae beetles and Burkholderia gladioli, a bacterium mostly known for its plant pathogenic traits. In Lagria hirta and Lagria villosa beetles, I localized these bacteria on adults, larvae and eggs of both species confirming a vertical transmission route. The presence of B. gladioli in these and four other Lagriinae species suggested that the association is relatively ancient and evolved within this phytopathogenic bacterial group. Additionally, B. gladioli from L. villosa can successfully infect soybean plants, a food source for this beetle species, and negatively affect the plant’s reproductive output, implying that the insect symbiont conserves the ability to intimately interact with a plant. Presumably, the potential of plant pathogenic B. gladioli bacteria to produce potent bioactive substances was also essential for establishing a mutualism with the insect. In L. villosa beetles, I could show that B. gladioli on the surface of eggs inhibit the growth of antagonistic fungi. I thereby demonstrate a symbiont-mediated defense, which could be highly advantageous at the nutrient-rich and immobile egg stage. Furthermore, we elucidated four compounds (toxoflavin, caryoynencin, lagriene and lagriamide) that could be responsible for the protective effect by the symbionts.

Nanotechnology is a buzzword in context of the proceeding miniaturization of devices and their components. Nanoparticles (NPs) can nowadays easily be synthesized from different material compositions by different chemical and physical processes. However, most of these techniques work close to or at the thermal equilibrium. One subsequent approach to tune materials beyond equilibrium conditions is ion beam irradiation. An important effect of this approach is sputtering. Sputtering is enhanced in NPs compared to their bulk counterparts due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, especially when the ion range matches the NP size. In this work, the sputtering effects of Ar+ and Ga+ ion irradiated Au nanoparticles are investigated in detail by Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a variety of experiments. The sputtering of Ar+ and Ga+ irradiated Au NPs was investigated as a function of ion energy, NP size and impact parameter by the MC code iradina and MD code parcas. The simulation results are directly compared to experiments using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of Au NPs on top of Si, whereat the sputter yields are significantly enhanced compared to the MC simulations. Additionally, the interaction of NPs and substrate were investigated by Rutherford backscatter spectrometry (RBS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). A new MC code was developed to study the redeposition of sputtered atoms of Ga+ irradiated Au NP arrays on neighboring NPs. The redeposition can lead to growth of NPs with diameters of 1 nm in vicinity of ~50 nm NP. These simulations are directly compared to an in situ experiment.

The focus of this thesis was to gain in-depth structural information of synthetic polymers by the application of several combined techniques. The second chapter provides an overview about the influence of the polymer architecture on its characterization by mass spectrometry and complementary methods. In the third chapter, we demonstrate the use of MS, more specifically MALDI-ToF MS, which provides molar masses and dispersity values for poly(furfuryl glycidyl ether) (PFGE). The second example is the study of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNiPAm) copolymers with glyco-monomers with specific combinations of matrices and cationization agents. The fourth chapter will combine three different examples regarding linear, star-shaped and hybrid polymers, which were analyzed by advanced techniques. The linear copolymers were analyzed by separating them according to their chemical heterogeneity using liquid absorption chromatography at critical conditions (LACCC) of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx), followed by automated spotting onto a MALDI target, which was subsequently analyzed by MALDI. Secondly, star-shaped polymers: [poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-b-PEtOx]8 were monitored firstly by using LACCC of linear PEO as first separation dimension and furthermore injected onto an SEC column confirming the molar mass. Lastly, a hybrid PEO star-shaped polymer was investigated using MALDI to verify the complete functionality of the core with PEO arms. Finally, the last chapter will focus on the creation of a software to obtain information regarding average composition, overcoming isotopic, overlapping peaks and isobaric species from MS spectra. Moreover, the quantitative studies were carried out by correction of the mass discrimination and isotopic abundance. Consequently, advanced analytical techniques such as different ionization techniques within MS, a range of chromatographic hyphenation and computational methods are implemented for elucidating the complexity of synthetic polymers.", "title_en": "Characterization of macromolecular systems by mass spectrometry and hyphenated techniques"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4046699-1", "gnd:4009840-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:36164-1; gnd:1124709509", "year": "2017", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

By means of the functional renormalization group (FRG), systems can be described in a nonperturbative way. The derived flow equations are solved via pseudo-spectral methods. As they allow to resolve the full field dependence of the effective potential and provide highly accurate results, these numerical methods are very powerful but have hardly been used in the FRG context. We show their benefits using several examples. Moreover, we apply the pseudo-spectral methods to explore the phase diagram of a bosonic model with two coupled order parameters and to clarify the nature of a possible metastability of the Higgs-Yukawa potential.In the phase diagram of systems with two competing order parameters, fixed points govern multicritical behavior. Such systems are often discussed in the context of condensed matter. Considering the phase diagram of the bosonic model between two and three dimensions, we discover additional fixed points besides the well-known ones from studies in three dimensions. Interestingly, our findings suggest that in certain regions of the phase diagram, two universality classes coexist. To our knowledge, this is the first bosonic model where coexisting (multi-)criticalities are found. Also, the absence of nontrivial fixed points can have a physical meaning, such as in the electroweak sector of the standard model which suffers from the triviality problem. The electroweak transition giving rise to the Higgs mechanism is dominated by the Gaussian fixed point. Due to the low Higgs mass, perturbative calculations suggest a metastable potential. However, the existence of the lower Higgs-mass bound eventually is interrelated with the maximal ultraviolet extension of the standard model. A relaxation of the lower bound would mean that the standard model may be still valid to even higher scales. Within a simple Higgs-Yukawa model, we discuss the origin of metastabilities and mechanisms, which relax the Higgs-mass bound, including higher field operators.", "title_en": "From condensed matter to higgs physics : solving functional renormalization group equations globally in field space"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4177773-6", "gnd:4297710-1", "gnd:4496040-2", "gnd:4165788-3", "gnd:4132888-7", "gnd:4331341-3", "gnd:4154496-1", "gnd:4151966-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:36164-1; gnd:1126463833", "year": "2017", "type": "Thesis", "language_original": "en"}}

Settlement is human place to live and do various activities (Finch, 1980). Concept of settlement layout is closely associated with human and a set of thoughts and behaviors. In this case, idea of pattern of activities in a society that is core of a culture becomes main factor in process of formation of houses and environment in a settlement. Factors which affecting form (physical) of architecture in a settlement environment are socio-cultural, economic, and religious determinant factor that manifested architectural realization (Rapoport, 1969). Yogyakarta as the continuation of kingdom city in the Java Island finally exists as an Islamic kingdom that still remain to survive up to now. Impacts of this issue is appearance of various Moslem settlements to support typical character of an Islamic Kingdom. Mlangi is an area of oldest Moslem settlements in Yogyakarta has not been explored in details for progress especially in physical glasses recently. Everything basic group and individual who arrange houses and residences, starts from how it has spatial concept alone. Although concept is a very abstract thing to explain in details, but its existence can be detected by how they created their physical environment. This research conducted by these research questions: (1) What are spatial concepts owned by people in Mlangi and (2) How do spatial concepts owned by the people affect the settlements pattern? Process to search spatial concept owned by the people in Moslem residence, making Mlangi as study area, was approached by using phenomenological research method. The researcher have to self-involved directly in unstructured interviews, but remained in guideline framework of in interviews to make research process effective. Fistly, the researcher interviewed the key person, they are the head of Mlangi administration (pak Dukuh) in Mlangi and Sawahan. They were then give advices to who was capable person that could draw the spatial concept and had many story and knew the history of the settlements. Step by step of interview guided from one informant to next informant when the information had been told repeatedly. The next informant based on the last informant advice or who had close relationship with the last theme appeared. To complete the narration and draw the result of interview, researcher have to add additional information with photograph and descriptive picture that can be draw the settlement empirically. In process, 17 information units which found in field were consistent with sequence of interview events and flowing of theme to theme associated with Moslem residence of residence. Finally the interviews succeeded in abstracting 16 themes that may be classified into historic, socio-cultural, and spatial-concept dimensions in Mlangi. Process of analysis to find spatial concept owned by the people in Moslem settlements was carried out by dialogue of themes to find available substantive relationship. Four concepts successfully analyzed consist of concepts of personage, concept of religious implementation, concept of Jero-Jaba and concept of Interest. The four concepts are really associated with one and others in understanding how spatial concept owned by the people affects residence they occupy. Yet, concept of Jero-Jaba bases all concepts of people in Mlangi . This concept can be used to draw red yarn on how they utilize communal spaces in residence and layout rooms of their individual houses. This concept also eternalize residence patterns existing in Mlangi now where residence does not experience many changes from starting of this residence existence (from detection of generation currently still living), namely residence patterns concentrate on orientation to Masjid Pathok Negoro of Mlangi. This research was opening the potential research area, at least for the sociology, anthropology and demography research interest. So many unique character in Mlangi if looked at from how they maintain their spatial concept and manifested in their daily activities.

Abstract: The PC12 cell line is a well-established cell model system for analysing cell fate decisionmaking processes. When stimulated with the growth factor EGF the cells proliferate increasingly, when stimulated with the nerve growth factor NGF the cells differentiate into sympathetic-like neurons. Both processes are regulated via the ERK/MAPK pathway. In this context, signal duration of activated ERK seems to be the key mechanism for the emergence of the distinct cell fates. Whereas NGF stimulation results in sustained ERK activation and neuronal differentiation of the cell line, EGF stimulation activates ERK transiently and results in enhanced cell proliferation. How the temporal dynamics of ERK signalling are encoded and translated in order to specify cell fates has not been fully understood yet. <br>This thesis is the first comparison of the EGF and NGF induced transcriptome of PC12 cells on a time scale of 24 hours with high sample density. It was shown that the EGF and NGF stimulus activate a very similar set of genes, which initiates and modulates the cell fate decision. These genes’ expression dynamics, however, were different depending on the stimulus used: EGF stimulation induced a short impulse-like gene expression pattern, whereas NGF stimulation resulted in a long-sustained response. In line with previous studies it was demonstrated, that immediate early genes such as Egr1, Fos and Junb show an increased stability in the case of NGF stimulation. It was shown, that this is most likely due to a delayed negative transcriptional feedback via Fosl1, Atf3, Maff, Klf2 und Zfp36l2. Moreover it was demonstrated, that both cell fates, proliferation as well as differentiation, are not solely dependent on the ERK/MAPK pathway. Within the first hour after stimulation with EGF cross-talk between the MAPK and PI3K pathways seems necessary in order to induce enhanced cell proliferation. After stimulation with NGF a more complex and sequential activation of different pathways was identified. In this context the activation of the Il6 pathway and the uPA/uPAR complex seems to be of special importance. The activation of these two pathways was exclusively seen after NGF-stimulation, which encourages further research to gain a deeper understanding of their function in the process of neuronal differentiation. Additionally, Dusp6 was identified as a potentially important modulator of the PC12 cell fate.

They include solving the Helmholtz equations for the correlation function, employing the Wigner function to propagate light in phase space, or using modal expansion. In this work, we investigate the interaction of partially spatially coherent light with optical systems. Our modeling methods are based on the Wigner function and modal expansion. First, we utilize the thin element approximation in the Wigner function to propagate partially coherent light through discontinuous surfaces. Our examples include the phase step, grating, kinoform lens, axicon and lens array. Phase space provides a vivid picture for understanding the diffraction effects, e.g. the diffracted orders formed by a grating, the multiple foci of a kinoform lens, and the beam homogenizing effect of a lens array, etc. This approach facilitates the design of diffractive elements and the interpretation of optical effects. Second, we improve the propagation algorithms for the Wigner function. These implementations include removing a parabolic wavefront of a beam, and an efficient propagator based on rotating the phase space. Both algorithms increase the computational speed without losing any physical accuracy. To overcome certain limitations of our phase space propagators, we investigate the modal expansion method. We use Schell beams as examples, to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of eigenmode and shifted-elementary mode expansions. Afterward, we develop an expansion tool to efficiently propagate partially coherent light inside waveguides. This tool allows quick access to the light fields at any distance inside the waveguide. We thus obtain an accurate modeling of the diffraction effects produced by the waveguide structure. Our modeling methods pave the path to the experimental measurement of coherence. We discuss two schemes to retrieve the spatial coherence of a beam under test. The first scheme is to solve an inverse problem of the modal expansion. It requires iterative phase retrieval algorithms to recover the complex fields of individual modes. We extend this method to a beam with an arbitrary wavefront and discuss the potential and limits of this technique. The second scheme for coherence retrieval is to solve the inverse problem of the Wigner function, also known as the phase space tomography. To reconstruct a Wigner function requires an inverse Radon transform in a four-dimensional space.
