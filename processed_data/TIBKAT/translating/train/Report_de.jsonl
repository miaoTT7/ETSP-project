Many disciplines of the humanities and social sciences have long followed this maxim. However, the natural sciences have traditionally sought simple, universal and timeless laws. They wanted to explain the \"blooming, buzzing confusion\", William James, which presents the untrained senses to the mind. But this company failed. Sandra Mitchell shows that the complexity of the living world forces us to radically revise our thinking models and to look for a more adequate teaching of knowledge. To this end, the system theory has provided guidelines that have been specified for some years by the complexity theory. Complex systems - such as the world in which we live - are characterized by, among other things, the emergence and relations: what becomes visible on the macro level is only to explain parts by interactions between the elements of the system.

Sludge and biowaste still cause relevant greenhouse gas emissions due to the necessary storage, treatment and recovery. They are already used in biogas plants to provide renewable energy. However, there are still potential for expansion for this use route. However, the mobilisation of the material flows seems to be extremely complex and difficult. Therefore, this project report presents the state of knowledge in order to identify existing barriers and possibilities of mobilising manure and biowaste for biogas production and derive from these practical proposals for action. Among other things, a proposal for adapting the EEG funding, which is intended to stimulate the use of manure in biogas plants more strongly, has been developed, but also pointed out that, according to the polluter principle, measures in agriculture should be considered. Proposals for the increased use of biowaste in fermentation plants, for example, relate to the increased collection of biomaterials separately, the promotion of biowaste fermentation plants within the framework of the EEG and support for municipalities.", "title_en": "Current development and prospects of biogas production from biowaste and manure : Final report"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4145600-2", "gnd:4172777-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Rensberg, Nadja; Daniel-Gromke, Jaqueline; Grope, Johan; Stinner, Walter; Richter, Felix; Denysenko, Velina", "year": "2018", "type": "Report", "language_original": "de"}}

One way to improve the utilization rate of seasonal and weather-related fluctuating electricity generation from renewable energy sources is the Power-to-Gas strategy. In this process, electrical energy, ideally \"over-power electricity\", is transferred into a chemical form (hydrogen). This transformation step thus enables the storage of the electrical energy which is not acceptable from the electricity grid. Moreover, the feed into the natural gas network gives the possibility to distribute this energy over the surface. However, due to the chemical and physical properties of hydrogen, this recovery route is not unlimited, therefore a further conversion into the energy carrier methane is sought.", "title_en": "Final report for the study and further development of a process for the biological enrichment of biogas by means of an innovative bed-bed process (internal and external biological enrichment by the bed-bed process – an upgrade for classic biogas plants)"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4307166-1", "gnd:4176074-8", "gnd:4145600-2", "gnd:4178126-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1037280792; gnd:10062714-6; gnd:5090756-6", "year": "2021", "type": "Report", "language_original": "de"}}

The volume contains the results of the working group \"Spatial risk management in technology and environment\". Thus, for the first time, it has been possible to present the mutual overlap between disaster preparedness and spatially oriented planning in important basic principles. Spatial sciences have paid little attention to the large, disaster-related risks in environment and technology in the past. At the same time, the spatial dimension in the various scientific approaches to this topic has often been neglected. In view of the state of scientific research, the regional or spatial implications of major risks in environment and technology are systematically brought to the fore here. In this context, impacts on the human capital of a society are considered as well as on the natural, real and social capital. Often, it is an inappropriate use of sites and institutional deficits in social systems that are responsible for outstanding risks. The working group assumes that from the integrative view of spatial planning the anthropogenic dimension of large environmental and technical risks is the focus of interest.

Maritime transport made it possible to spread urban civilization. War on the sea helped to break through the Athenian democracy. The conquest of the sea was a prerequisite for the emergence of the Roman empire, allowing the unification of Greek-Roman civilization and the spread of Christianity. The search for fame and wealth finally prompted Mediterranean sailors to venture into the oceans and consider a journey to India over 1000 years before Columbus. Raimund Schulz describes the driving forces that Greeks and Romans repeatedly moved to sea, and clears up with numerous legends and prejudices such as the alleged anti-sea nature of the Romans. He describes the essential stages of the \"conquest\" of the sea, taking into account in particular the world of adventurers, mercenaries and outsiders who were at home on the sea.

This development is particularly noteworthy in the area of infrastructure and supply services. In addition to the commercialization of public services so far, the ecological modernization of some infrastructure systems results in a far-reaching transformation dynamic. This concerns particularly the systems of energy and water supply as well as wastewater disposal, which organize a significant part of the metabolism between nature and society. It is to be assumed that these developments trigger significant spatial changes. The aim of the study is therefore to analyse various aspects of the spatial change of German energy and water supply. Here, various scientific discussion strands are brought together, where important aspects are supplemented and critically reflected in the context of the situation in Germany. The study is primarily intended to structure a new spatial scientific research field.

Duplicate detection describes the finding of multiple data sets representing the same real world object. This task is not trivial, as (i) the data sets may differ slightly, so that similarity measures are needed for a pair-wise comparison, and (ii) due to the data set a complete pair-wise comparison is not possible. To solve the second problem, there are different algorithms that partition the data set and only make comparisons within the partitions. One of these algorithms is the Sorted Neighborhood Method (SNM), which sorts data by key and then passes a window over the sorted data. Comparisons are only carried out within this window. We describe different variations of the Sorted Neighborhood method based on varying window sizes. These approaches are based on the intuition that areas with larger and smaller similarities exist within the sorted data sets, for which correspondingly larger or smaller window sizes are useful. We describe and evaluate different adaptation strategies as being verifiable in terms of the same type of the original method.", "title_en": "Adaptive windows for duplicate detection"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4191565-3", "gnd:4011133-7", "gnd:4328500-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2012", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

The research shows that the insufficient innovation dynamics of eastern Germany is not only a cyclical or even mental phenomenon, but a structural one. The analysis underlines a special need for action in the eastern Länder, since on the one hand small enterprises are present in large numbers, also the middle class is largely established overall, but in East-West comparison still established large companies are found as partners less frequently and cause a positive charisma effect on medium-sized subcontracting enterprises. Also in Germany-East the financing ratio is special, i.e. the proportion of external financing is differentiated. Accordingly, the „Hausbank\" should be able to test the outstanding importance of the medium-sized enterprises due to its structural funding.

This has changed with the use of computer technology. More often, personal, social, aesthetic and playful dimensions are brought to the fore. The use of modern gadgets (smartphone, PC tablet & co.) with their versatile possibilities is playful and thus conceals effort and time expenditure. Modern technology use appears to be self-determined. Increasingly, members of society are making temporal, financial and social expenditures in order to be constantly accessible and ready to act. One of the consequences of technological everyday action is a stronger accentuation of \"now\", as well as the increased importance of aesthetics, convenience and emotion. The \"rational\" purpose-determined use of apparatus thus enters the background, as well as the role of technology as an instrument of standardization and effectivisation.

(Ingrid Rall-Haiss) The very informative and understandable non-fiction book of the two mineralogens Neukirchen (\"Moved Mountains\", ID-A 14/11, \"Edelsteine\", ID-G 24/12) and Ries explains the world of ores, fossil energy sources, industrial minerals and mass raw materials (e.g. salts, stones and earths). Part 1 deals with different types of deposits and their formation. Important historical (e.g. black forest, resin) but also current deposits worldwide are presented on land and in the sea. Part 2 is classified according to the raw materials. In addition to the creation, properties, use, mining and preparation, it also deals with economic, political, social and ecological aspects.

In addition, in combination with other energy systems such as photovoltaic systems, they allow a continuous and decentralized energy supply. In the operation of different energy systems it is desirable that the systems work together. However, it is difficult to operate heterogeneous energy systems efficiently with each other so far. Thus, saving potentials remain unused. A central control system can therefore improve the efficiency of the overall system. With ecoControl we present an expandable prototype that optimizes the cooperation of energy systems and involves environmental factors. To this end, the software provides a uniform control interface for the configuration of all systems to be used. In addition, it offers the possibility to develop optimization algorithms with the help of a programming interface, to test and execute them.

The book presents methods and projects that allow new media to be reflected and used in a didactically productive way in German lessons. The pedagogical discussion of digital media is still shaped by the fact that German lessons see their goal in preserving the \"old\" media (the \"good\" book). Therefore, platforms and social networks that have become commonplace for young people are primarily regarded as a threat. This perspective has spilled the view on the potential of new media. Philippe Wampfler changes this by showing concrete examples of how contemporary German lessons can reflect and productively use the changed conditions for literature, writing and reading. An introduction with didactic insights on working with digital tools follows teaching units that can be used directly at different school levels and levels of teachers.
