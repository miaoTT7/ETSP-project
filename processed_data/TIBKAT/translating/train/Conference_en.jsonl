The issue of counter power is then discussed against this background.

A central argument in the book is that in spite of economic reforms and social advances on a range of arenas, the fundamental tenants of socio-economic inequalities have not been challenged substantially. As several countries are now experiencing a return to right-wing politics, this collection helps us better understand why inequalities are so entrenched in the Latin American continent, but also the complex and creative ways that it is continuously contested.

Design and Implementation of service-oriented architectures imposes a huge number of research questions from the fields of software engineering, system analysis and modeling, adaptability, and application integration. Component orientation and web services are two approaches for design and realization of complex web-based system. Both approaches allow for dynamic application adaptation as well as integration of enterprise application. Commonly used technologies, such as J2EE and .NET, form de facto standards for the realization of complex distributed systems. Evolution of component systems has lead to web services and service-based architectures. This has been manifested in a multitude of industry standards and initiatives such as XML, WSDL UDDI, SOAP, etc. All these achievements lead to a new and promising paradigm in IT systems engineering which proposes to design complex software solutions as collaboration of contractually defined software services. Service-Oriented Systems Engineering represents a symbiosis of best practices in object-orientation, component-based development, distributed computing, and business process management. It provides integration of business and IT concerns.The annual Ph.D. Retreat of the Research School provides each member the opportunity to present his/her current state of their research and to give an outline of a prospective Ph.D. thesis. Due to the interdisciplinary structure of the research school, this technical report covers a wide range of topics. These include but are not limited to: Human Computer Interaction and Computer Vision as Service; Service-oriented Geovisualization Systems; Algorithm Engineering for Service-oriented Systems; Modeling and Verification of Self-adaptive Service-oriented Systems; Tools and Methods for Software Engineering in Service-oriented Systems; Security Engineering of Service-based IT Systems; Service-oriented Information Systems; Evolutionary Transition of Enterprise Applications to Service Orientation; Operating System Abstractions for Service-oriented Computing; and Services Specification, Composition, and Enactment. Der Entwurf und die Realisierung dienstbasierender Architekturen wirft eine Vielzahl von Forschungsfragestellungen aus den Gebieten der Softwaretechnik, der Systemmodellierung und -analyse, sowie der Adaptierbarkeit und Integration von Applikationen auf. Komponentenorientierung und WebServices sind zwei Ansätze für den effizienten Entwurf und die Realisierung komplexer Web-basierender Systeme. Sie ermöglichen die Reaktion auf wechselnde Anforderungen ebenso, wie die Integration großer komplexer Softwaresysteme. Heute übliche Technologien, wie J2EE und .NET, sind de facto Standards für die Entwicklung großer verteilter Systeme. Die Evolution solcher Komponentensysteme führt über WebServices zu dienstbasierenden Architekturen. Dies manifestiert sich in einer Vielzahl von Industriestandards und Initiativen wie XML, WSDL, UDDI, SOAP.

How can computers recognize faces? Why are caricatures of famous faces so easily recognized? Originally published in 1995, much of the previous research on face recognition had been phenomena driven. Recent empirical work together with the application of computational, mathematical and statistical techniques have provided new ways of conceptualizing the information available in faces. These advances have led researchers to suggest that many phenomena can be explained by the structure of the information available in the population(s) of faces. This broad approach has drawn together a number of apparently disparate phenomena with a common theoretical basis, including cross-race recognition; the distinctiveness of faces; the production and recognition of caricatures; and the determinants of facial attractiveness. This title provides a state of the art review of the field at the time in which the authors use a wide variety of approaches. What is common to all is that the authors base the accounts of the phenomena they study or their model of face recognition on the statistics of the information available in the population of faces. On publication this title was a comprehensive, up-to-date review of an important area of research in face recognition written by active researchers. It includes contributions from mathematics, computer science and neural network theory as well as psychology. It is aimed at research workers and postgraduate students and will be of interest to cognitive psychologists and computer scientists interested in face recognition. It will also be of interest to those working on neural network models of visual recognition, perceptual development, expertise in visual cognition as well as facial attractiveness and caricature.", "title_en": "Psychology library editions: perception ; volume 29: Cognitive and computational aspects of face recognition : explorations in face space"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4125909-9", "gnd:1142448436"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1091510512", "year": "1995", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This Special Publication examines tsunami hazard and risk, with particular focus on using the geological record. With Earth's growing population clustered increasingly on coastlines, tsunami hazards are of concern worldwide. The papers explore the sedimentological and dynamic traces of recent and prehistoric tsunamis globally - from Europe to the Pacific - as well as looking at historic records and how the information can be used to characterise the scale of impacts and areas that are most susceptible to tsunami hazards. Armed with this information, scientists can begin to quantify risks, both to populations and in economic terms.

With beautiful photographs of private and public buildings by Julius Shulman, Candida Hofer, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth, and others, this book examines the central and active role that photography plays in defining and perpetuating the iconic nature of buildings and places. This volume shows how different photographers represent the same building, offers commentaries on the American dream, and explores changes in commercial architectural photography. Placing decades-old images alongside modern ones, Image Building depicts the idea of the comfortable middle-class home and the construction of suburbia as an ironic ideal. It presents the ways that public spaces such as libraries, museums, theaters, and office buildings are experienced differently as photographers highlight the social, cultural, psychological, and aesthetic conditions to reveal the layered meanings of place and identity.

This ambitious book seeks both to revive and revise the idea of 'functional finance'. Followers of this doctrine believe that government budgets should concentrate solely on their macroeconomic impact on the economy, rather than reflecting a concern for sound finance and budgetary discipline. Reinventing Functional Finance examines the origins of this idea and then considers it in a modern context. The authors explore the concept of NAIRU and argue that modern economies can operate at the level of full employment without provoking unmanageable inflation. They also contend that budget deficits do not have the deleterious effects commonly ascribed to them; the belief that they do rests on a misunderstanding of modern money. In this context, they highlight the relevance of Abba Lerner's famous dictum, 'money is a creature of the State'. The authors also debate the merits of various proposals for 'Employer of Last Resort' programs, which combine automatic stabilizers with the buffer stock principle pt. I. Introduction -- pt. II.

It appears to require the existence of new particles whose interactions to ordinary matter are extraordinarily feeble. One well-motivated candidate is the axion, an extraordinarily light neutral particle that may possibly be detected by looking for their conversion to detectable microwaves in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This has led to a number of experimental searches that are beginning to probe plausible axion model space and may discover the axion in the near future. These proceedings discuss the challenges of designing and operating tunable resonant cavities and detectors at ultralow temperatures. The topics discussed here have potential application far beyond the field of dark matter detection and may be applied to resonant cavities for accelerators as well as designing superconducting detectors for quantum information and computing applications. This work is intended for graduate students and researchers interested in learning the unique requirements for designing and operating microwave cavities and detectors for direct axion searches and to introduce several proposed experimental concepts that are still in the prototype stage.

Moreover, the debate surrounding it has made clear that fundamental questions of network compliant regulation have not yet been fully answered.

This volume contains the proceedings of the 16th international conference, held from June 19-23, 2017. The papers are original research articles covering a large range of topics, including weight enumerators for codes, function field analogs of the Brauer-Siegel theorem, the computation of cohomological invariants of curves, the trace distributions of algebraic groups, and applications of the computation of zeta functions of curves. Despite the varied topics, the papers share a common thread: the beautiful interplay between abstract theory and explicit results", "title_en": "Arithmetic geometry: computation and applications : 16th International Conference on Arithmetic, Geometry, Cryptography, and Coding Theory, June 19-23, 2017, Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques, Marseille, France"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4139405-7", "gnd:4002919-0", "gnd:4020236-7", "gnd:4033329-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1176206664", "year": "2019", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Cherkas and V.L. Kalashnikov This book collects interrelated lectures on fractal dynamics, anomalous transport and various historical and modern aspects of plasma sciences and technology. The origins of plasma science in connection to electricity and electric charges and devices leading to arc plasma are explored in the first contribution by Jean-Marc Ginoux and Thomas Cuff. The second important historic connection with plasmas was magnetism and the magnetron. Victor J. Law and Denis P. Dowling, in the second contribution, review the history of the magnetron based on the development of thermionic diode valves and related devices. In the third chapter, Christos H Skiadas and Charilaos Skiadas present and apply diffusion theory and solution strategies to a number of stochastic processes of interest. Anomalous diffusion by the fractional Fokker-Planck equation and Lévy stable processes are studied by Johan Anderson and Sara Moradi in the fourth contribution. They consider the motion of charged particles in a 3-dimensional magnetic field in the presence of linear friction and of a stochastic electric field. Analysis of low-frequency instabilities in a low-temperature magnetized plasma is presented by Dan-Gheorghe Dimitriu, Maricel Agop in the fifth chapter. The authors refer to experimental results of the Innsbruck Q-machine and provide an analytical formulation of the related theory. In chapter six, Stefan Irimiciuc, Dan-Gheorghe Dimitriu, Maricel Agop propose a theoretical model to explain the dynamics of charged particles in a plasma discharge with a strong flux of electrons from one plasma structure to another. The theory and applications of fractional derivatives in many-particle disordered large systems are explored by Z.Z. Alisultanov, A.M. Agalarov, A.A. Potapov, G.B. Ragimkhanov. In chapter eight, Maricel Agop, Alina Gavrilut¸ and Gabriel Crumpei explore the motion of physical systems that take place on continuous but non-differentiable curves (fractal curves).

In this small book, theoretical physicist Gerard 't Hooft (Nobel prize 1999), philosopher Emanuele Severino (Lincei Academician), and theologian Piero Coda (Pontifical Lateran University) confront one another on a topic that lies at the roots of quantum mechanics and at the origin of Western thought: Determinism and Free Will. \"God does not play dice\" said Einstein, a tenacious determinist. Quantum Mechanics and its clash with General Relativity have reanimated ancient dilemmas about chance and necessity: Is Nature deterministic? Is Man free? The “free-will theorem” by Conway and Kochen, and the deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics proposed by 't Hooft, revive such philosophical questions in modern Physics. Is Becoming real?

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1051400031", "content": {"text": "Everything flows : towards a processual philosophy of biology. Against the traditional view of the living world as fundamentally composed of enduring things, this work argues for the radical alternative that it essentially consists of processes. Biology is the study of the processes that constitute living beings, and the things biologists study ultimately derive their existence from more basic processes. This collection of essays explores the metaphysical thesis that the living world is not ontologically made up of substantial particles or things, as has often been assumed, but is rather constituted by processes. The biological domain is organized as an interdependent hierarchy of processes, which are stabilized and actively maintained at different timescales. Even entities that intuitively appear to be paradigms of things, such as organisms, are actually better understood as processes. Unlike previous attempts to articulate processual views of biology, which have tended to use Alfred North Whitehead’s panpsychist metaphysics as a foundation, this book takes a naturalistic approach to metaphysics. It submits that the main motivations for replacing an ontology of substances with one of processes are to be looked for in the empirical findings of science. Biology provides compelling reasons for thinking that the living realm is fundamentally dynamic and that the existence of things is always conditional on the existence of processes. The phenomenon of life cries out for theories that prioritize processes over things, and it suggests that the central explanandum of biology is not change but rather stability—or, more precisely, stability attained through constant change. This multicontributor volume brings together philosophers of science and metaphysicians interested in exploring the consequences of a processual philosophy of biology. The contributors draw on an extremely wide range of biological case studies and employ a process perspective to cast new light on a number of traditional philosophical problems such as identity, persistence, and individuality", "title_en": "Everything flows : towards a processual philosophy of biology"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4006851-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2018", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Even minute increases in a country's growth rate can result in dramatic changes in living standards over just one generation. - The benefits of growth, however, may not be shared equally. Some may gain less than others, and a fraction of the population may actually be disadvantaged. Recent economic research has found both positive and negative relationships between growth and inequality across nations. The questions raised by these results include: What is the impact on inequality of policies designed to foster growth? Does inequality by itself facilitate or detract from economic growth, and does it amplify or diminish policy effectiveness? - This book provides a forum for economists to examine the theoretical, empirical, and policy issues involved in the relationship between growth and inequality. The aim is to develop a framework for determining the role of public policy in enhancing both growth and equality.

In May 2004 the European Union will undergo the largest expansion in its history when ten countries--Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia--become members.

Not only do these countries vary widely in language, culture, and geography, but also their per capita income is less than half that of existing members.

As a result of the Bologna Process, the need to connect higher education with research has become an important issue. For a discipline such as architecture, this seems to put the traditional and well-established equilibrium between theory and praxis under pressure, or even under threat. Research is undertaken in order to construct knowledge through the acquisition of insight and understanding, with the aim of sharing the results. In architecture schools, design lies at the heart of the educational programme, with the design studio being the central locus. Since design and research are inextricably linked, the relationship between knowledge production and the design process has become a subject of investigation. The interweaving of research and design-based architectural education also affects the relationship between teaching and design.

Klappentext: In 1831 Old London Bridge was demolished following the construction of Sir John Rennie's replacement structure. Begun in 1176, it was the first stone bridge to have been erected across the Thames and until 1763 it had boasted a famous parade of shops and houses on either side of a narrow thoroughfare. Throughout Europe whole communities were supported by such habitable bridges. The last bridge of this type to be built in Britain was Pulteney Bridge constructed in Bath in 1773. This work examines the contribution that habitable bridges have made to city life from the Middle Ages to the present day. The history and construction of major inhabited bridges in Europe, the Middle East and America are discussed in detail. In Europe these include Old London Bridge, the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Venice's Rialto Bridge and the Pont de Notre Dame in Paris. One section of the book is devoted to presenting the seven shortlisted entries in a competition to design a habitable bridge for London, spanning the Thames from Temple Gardens on the North Bank to the area in front of London Weekend Television building in the south.

Urban space is a commons: simultaneously a sphere of human cooperation and negotiation and its product. Understanding urban space as a commons means that the much sought-after productivity of the city precedes rather than results from strategies of the state and capital. This approach challenges assumptions of urbanization as capital-driven, an idea which resonates with a range of recent urban social movements, from the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement to the \"Right to the City\" alliance. However commons exist in a tense relationship with state and market, both of which continually seek to exploit and control them. Initiatives to create \"commons\" are welcomed and even facilitated by governments in order to (re-)valorize urban space and lessen the impacts of economic restructuring, while, at the same time, the creative and reproductive potential of the urban commons is undermined by continuing attempts to commodify them. This volume examines these topics theoretically and empirically through a wide spectrum of international case studies providing perspectives from a variety of cities as diverse as Berlin, Hyderabad and Seoul.

The theory of argumentation is a rich, interdisciplinary area of research involving philosophy, communications studies, linguistics, psychology, and logics. Its techniques have found a wide range of applications in both theoretical and practical branches of artificial intelligence and computer science. Multi-agent systems theory has picked up argumentation inspired approaches and specifically argumentation-theoretic results from many different areas. Researchers in argumentation and multi-agent systems are currently enjoying a unique opportunity&nbsp;to integrate the various understandings of argument into a coherent and core part of the functioning of autonomous computational systems. This book originates from the First International Workshop on Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems, ArgMAS 2004, held in New York, NY, USA in July 2004. Besides 12 selected revised full papers taken from the workshop, 4 additional papers by key people in the area to round off overall coverage of the relevant topics.

This book overviews environmental issues 4 years after the Fukushima nuclear accident, covering a wide range of areas related to radiation and radioactivity. The topics discussed are necessary to make clear the relationship between the results of research and Fukushima's revitalized future. The chapters are divided into four parts: Part 1 presents the identification of radionuclides in soil and migration of radionuclides in the terrestrial environment; Part 2 describes the safety decontamination system and treatment of radioactive waste; Part 3 explains the development of the system of measurement of environmental radiation and evaluation of external exposure; and Part 4 discusses the identification of radionuclides in farm products, control of root uptake, identification of decreasing radionuclides by food processing, and evaluation of internal exposure. Since the accident at the Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in 2011, gradual steps have been taken toward environmental recovery in the area. However, there are still many issues that need to be tackled in order to achieve the full revitalization of Fukushima. These issues encompass many different disciplines such as economics, psychology, and sociology. In this kind of situation, the role of science in relation to radiation and radioactivity is especially important. This book aims to contribute to planning countermeasures against nuclear disasters in the future.

The increasing involvement of unmanned means and methods of warfare can lead to a total removal of humans from the navigation, command and decision-making processes in the control of unmanned systems, and as such away from participation in hostilities - the “dehumanization of warfare.” This raises the question of whether and how today’s law is suitable for governing the dehumanization of warfare effectively. Which rules are relevant? Do interpretations of relevant rules need to be reviewed or is further and adapted regulation necessary?

The objective of this ASI was to identify and discuss areas where synergism between modern physics, soft condensed matter and biology might be most fruitful. The main pedagogical approach was to have lecturers focussing on basic understanding of important aspects of the relative role of the various interaction- electrostatic, hydrophobic, steric, conformational, van der Waals etc. Soft condensed matter and the connection between physics and biology have been the themes of several earlier Geilo Schools. A return to these subjects thus allowed a fresh look and a possibility for defining new directions for research. Examples of soft materials, which were discussed at this ASI, included colloidal dispersions, gels, biopolymers and charged polymer solutions, polyelectrolytes, protein/membrane complexes, nucleic acids and their complexes. Indeed, most forms of condensed matter are soft and these substances are composed of aggregates and macromolecules, with interactions that are too weak and complex to form crystals spontaneously. A characteristic feature is that small external forces, slight perturbations in temperature, pressure or concentration, can all be enough to induce significant structural changes. Thermal fluctuations are almost by definition strong in soft materials and entropy is a predominant determinant of structure, so that disorder, slow dynamics and plastic deformation are the rule. Hence the phrase ‘soft condensed matter’ has been coined", "title_en": "Forces, Growth and Form in Soft Condensed Matter: At the Interface between Physics and Biology"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4256351-3", "gnd:4311495-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:13642712X", "year": "2005", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Each year young mathematicians congregate in Saint Flour, France, and listen to extended lecture courses on new topics in Probability Theory. The goal of these notes, representing a course given by Terry Lyons in 2004, is to provide a straightforward and self supporting but minimalist account of the key results forming the foundation of the theory of rough paths. The proofs are similar to those in the existing literature, but have been refined with the benefit of hindsight. The theory of rough paths aims to create the appropriate mathematical framework for expressing the relationships between evolving systems, by extending classical calculus to the natural models for noisy evolving systems, which are often far from differentiable.

The problem of state reconstruction in dynamical systems, known as observer problem, is undoubtedly crucial for controlling or just monitoring processes. For linear systems, the corresponding theory has been quite well established for several years now, and the purpose of the present book is to propose an overview on possible tools in that respect for nonlinear systems. Basic observability notions and observer structures are first recalled, together with ingredients for advanced designs on this basis. A special attention is then paid to the well-known high gain techniques with a summary of various corresponding recent results. A focus on the celebrated Extended Kalman filter is also given, in the perspectives of both nonlinear filtering and high gain observers, leading to so-called adaptive-gain observers. The more specific immersion approach for observer design is then emphasized, while optimization-based methods are also presented as an alternative to analytic observers. Various practical application examples are included in those discussions, and some fields of application are further considered: first the problem of nonlinear output regulation is reformulated in a perspective of observers, and then the problem of parameter or fault estimation is briefly mentioned through some adaptive observer tools.", "title_en": "Nonlinear Observers and Applications"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4121208-3", "gnd:4276212-1", "gnd:4139504-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2007", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

In the past decades, much progress has been made in the field of walking robots. The current state of technology makes it possible to create humanoid robots that nearly walk like a human being, climb stairs, or avoid small - stacles. However, the dream of a robot running as fast and as elegantly as a human is still far from becoming reality. Control of such fast motions is still a big technological issue in robotics, and the maximum running speed of contemporary robots is still much smaller than that of human track runners. The conventional control approach that most of these robots are based on does not seem to be suitable to increase the running speeds up to a biological level. In order to address this challenge, we invited an interdisciplinary community of researchers from robotics, biomechanics, control engineering and applied mathematics to come together in Heidelberg at the Symposium “Fast Motions in Biomechanics and Robotics – Optimization & Feedback Control” which was held at the International Science Forum (IWH) on September 7–9, 2005.

So far the communication between man and computers has displayed a one-way nature, humans have to know how the - chines work and only then can they “understand” them. The opposite, however, is still quite far from being real, our understanding of how our “user-friendly” computers can understand us humans is not deep enough yet. A lot of work has to be done both in the near and distant future. Let TSD 2002 be a modest contribution to this goal. The conference also serves well in its second purpose: to facilitate researchers meeting in the NLP ?eld from Western and Eastern Europe. Moreover, many participants now come from other parts of the world, thus making TSD a real crossroadsforresearchersintheNLParea. Thisvolumecontainstheproceedings of this conference held in Brno, September 9–12, 2002. We were honored to have as keynote speakers James Pustejovsky from Brandeis University, and Ronald Cole from the University of Colorado. We would like to thank all the Program Committee members and external reviewers for their conscientious and diligent reviewing work.

Six leading experts lecture on a wide spectrum of recent results on the subject of the title, providing both a solid reference and deep insights on current research activity. Michael Cowling presents a survey of various interactions between representation theory and harmonic analysis on semisimple groups and symmetric spaces. Alain Valette recalls the concept of amenability and shows how it is used in the proof of rigidity results for lattices of semisimple Lie groups. Edward Frenkel describes the geometric Langlands correspondence for complex algebraic curves, concentrating on the ramified case where a finite number of regular singular points is allowed. Masaki Kashiwara studies the relationship between the representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups and the geometry of the flag manifolds associated with the corresponding complex algebraic groups. David Vogan deals with the problem of getting unitary representations out of those arising from complex analysis, such as minimal globalizations realized on Dolbeault cohomology with compact support. Nolan Wallach illustrates how representation theory is related to quantum computing, focusing on the study of qubit entanglement.

Both kinds of problems have a large number of applications from a variety of ?elds. WAOA 2005 took place in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, on 6–7 October 2005. The workshop was part of the ALGO 2005 event that also hosted ESA, WABI, and ATMOS. The two previous WAOA workshops were held in Budapest (2003) and Rome (2004). Topics of interest for WAOA 2005 were: algorithmic game theory, appro- mation classes, coloring and partitioning, competitive analysis, computational ?nance, cuts and connectivity, geometric problems, inapproximability results, mechanism design, network design, packing and covering, paradigms, rand- izationtechniques,real-worldapplications,andschedulingproblems.Inresponse to the call for papers we received 68 submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least three referees, and the vast majority by at least four referees. The submissions were mainly judged on originality, technical quality, and relevance to the topics of the conference. Based on the reviews, the Program Committee selected 26 papers.

The conference incorporated three different workshops that took place separately in previous years. The IBM Verification Workshop is now its sixth year, the IBM Software Testing Workshop is now in its fourth year, and the PADTAD Workshop on testing and debugging multi-threaded and parallel software was held for the third time. The Verification Conference was a three-day, single-track conference followed by a one-day tutorial on the testing and review of multi-threaded code. The conference presented a unique combination of fields that brought together the hardware and software testing communities. Merging the different communities under a single roof gave the conference a distinctive flavor and provided the participants with added benefits. While the applications in these separate fields are different, the techniques used are often very similar.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1646670760", "content": {"text": "Gesture in Human-Computer Interaction and Simulation : 6th International Gesture Workshop, GW 2005, Berder Island, France, May 18-20, 2005, Revised Selected Papers. The international Gesture Workshops have become the leading interdisciplinary events for dissemination of the latest results on gesture-based communication. The goal of these workshops is to bring together researchers who want to meet and share ideas on advanced research on gesture related to multidisciplinary scienti?c ?elds. Depending on the ?elds, the objectives can be very di?erent. While physiology and biomechanics aim to extract fundamental knowledge of physical gesture, computer sciences try to capture di?erent aspects of gesture and extract features that help to identify, interpret or rebuild the underlying mechanisms of communication gestures. Other approaches and methodologies are followed by cognitive sciences and linguistics, bringing a complementary - derstanding of motor control and gesture meaning.

Technological progress is one of the driving forces behind the dramatic devel- mentofcomputersystemarchitecturesoverthe pastthreedecades.Eventhough it is quite clear that this development cannot only be measured by the ma- mum number of components on a chip, Moore’s Law may be and is often taken as a simple measure for the non-braked growth of computational power over the years. The more components are realizable on a chip, the more innovative and unconventional ideas can be realized by system architects. As a result, research in computer system architectures is more exciting than ever before. This book coversthe trends that shape the ?eld of computer system archit- tures.Thefundamenataltrade-o?inthedesignofcomputing systemsis between ?exibility, performance,powerconsumption, andchip area.The full exploitation of future silicon capacity requires new architecture approaches and new design paradigms such as multiple computers on a single chip, recon?gurable processor arrays, extensible processor architectures, and embedded memory technologies. For a successful use in practical applications, it is not enough to solve the ha- wareproblemsbutalsotodevelopplatformsthatprovidesoftwareinfrastructure and support e?ective programming. A quantum jump in complexity is achieved by embedded computing systems with an unprecedented level of connectivity linking together a growing n- ber of physical devices through networks. Embedded systems will become more and more pervasive as the component technologies become smaller, faster, and cheaper. Their complexity arises not only from the large number of components but also from a lack of determinism and a continual evolution of these systems.", "title_en": "Architecture of Computing Systems - ARCS 2006 : 19th International Conference, Frankfurt/Main, Germany, March 13-16, 2006, Proceedings"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4238872-7", "gnd:4128144-5", "gnd:4048717-9", "gnd:4694120-4", "gnd:4532701-4", "gnd:4396978-1", "gnd:4739720-2", "gnd:4674811-8", "gnd:4077653-0", "gnd:4657367-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2006", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The Second IFIP Workshop on Autonomic Communication (WAC 2005) took place on October 2–5, 2005, in Athens, Greece. The previous (and first) edition of WAC took place in Berlin in 2004 and its next (and third) edition in Paris in 2006. The workshop was organized by the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and was supported by the EU-funded IST-FET Autonomic Communication Coordination Action (ACCA – IST-6475). Additional support was provided by the EU-funded IST Network of Excellence E-NEXT (IST-506869). Finally, IFIP TC6 provided scientific sponsorship through Working Groups IFIP WG6. 6 (Management of Networks and Distributed Systems) and IFIP WG6. 3 (Performance of Communication Systems). The workshop was organized at a time when the – yet to be well defined – field of autonomic communication (AC) is attracting the interest of both the scientific community and the research funding organizations. The latter is manifested, on one hand, by the numerous recent relevant research exploratory forums, workshop panels, preliminary forward-looking position papers, research outlooks and frameworks and, on the other hand, by the commitment of the FET program of the European Commission in Europe to funding long-term research in this area for the next four years. Consequently, the second edition of WAC was highly exploratory and included a nice mix of technical work addressing some already identified problems and well-articulated ideas on the direction this field should take and the fundamental problems whose solution would enable autonomicity.", "title_en": "Autonomic Communication (vol. # 3854) : Second International IFIP Workshop, WAC 2005, Athens, Greece, October 2-5, 2005, Revised Selected Papers"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4496068-2", "gnd:4314339-8", "gnd:4820003-7", "gnd:4133586-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2006", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Machine learning and cybernetics play an important role in many modern electronic, computer and communications systems. Automated processing of information by these systems requires intelligent analysis of various types of data and optimal decision making. In recent years, we have witnessed a rapid expansion of research and development activities in machine learning and cybernetics. To provide opportunities for researchers in these areas to share their ideas and foster collaborations, the International Conference on Machines and Cybernetics (ICMLC) has been held annually since 2002. The conference series has achieved a great success in attracting a large number of paper submissions and participants and enabling fruitful exchanges among academic and industrial researchers and postgraduate students. In 2005, the conference (ICMLC 2005) received 2461 full paper submissions and the Program Committee selected 1050 of them for presentation. It is especially encouraging that the conference is attracting more and more international attention. This year, there are contributions from 21 countries and 211 universities worldwide.

This PROPOR Workshop follows previous workshops held in 1993 (Lisbon, Portugal), 1996 (Curitiba, Brazil), 1998 (Porto Alegre, Brazil), 1999 ´ (Evora, Portugal), 2000 (Atibaia, Brazil) and 2003 (Faro, Portugal). The wo- shop has increasingly contributed to bringing together researchers and industry partners from both sides of the Atlantic. The constitution of an international Program Committee and the adoption of high-standard referee procedures demonstrate the steady development of the ?eld and of its scienti?c community. In 2006 PROPOR received 56 paper submissions from 11 di?erent countries: Brazil, Portugal, Spain, Norway, USA, Italy, Japan, France, Canada, Denmark and the UK, from which 9 are represented in the accepted papers. Each submitted paper underwent a careful, triple-blind review by the P- gram Committee. All those who contributed are mentioned in the following pages. The reviewing process led to the selection of 20 regular papers for oral presentation and 17 short papers for poster sections, which are published in this volume. The workshop and this book were structured around the following main t- ics, seven for full papers: (i) automatic summarization; (ii) resources; (iii) au- matic translation; (iv) named entity recognition; (v) tools and frameworks; (vi) systems and models; and another ?ve topics for short papers; (vii) information extraction; (viii) speech processing; (ix) lexicon; (x) morpho-syntactic studies; (xi) web, corpus and evaluation.

Networking 2006 was organized by the University of Coimbra, Portugal, and it was the fifth event in a series of International Conferences on Networking sponsored by the IFIP Technical Committee on Communication Systems (TC 6). Previous events were held in Paris (France) in 2000, Pisa (Italy) in 2002, Athens (Greece) in 2004, and Waterloo (Canada) in 2005. Networking 2006 brought together active and proficient members of the networking community, from both academia and industry, thus contributing to scientific, strategic, and practical advances in the broad and fast-evolving field of communications. The conference comprised highly technical sessions organized thematically, keynote talks, tutorials offered by experts, as well as workshops and panel discussions on topical themes. Plenary sessions with keynote talks opened the daily sessions, which covered Networking Technologies, Services and Protocols, Performance of Computer and Communication Networks, and Mobile and Wireless Communications Systems. The Networking 2006 call for papers attracted 440 submissions from 44 different countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. These were subject to thorough review work by the Program Committee members and additional reviewers. The selection process was finalized in a Technical Program Committee meeting held in Lisbon on January 23, 2006.", "title_en": "NETWORKING 2006.

Unbelievable, we have reached the seventh edition of the XP2k+n conference! We started at the outset of the new millennium, and we are still proving that agile pr- esses were neither a millennium bug nor a YAF (yet another fad). In its first editions, this conference was a get-together of a few pioneers who - bated about how to make agile processes and methods accepted by the mainstream researchers and practitioners in software engineering. Now agile approach to software development has been fully accepted by the software engineering community and this event has become the major forum for understanding better the implications of agility in software development and proposing extensions to the mainstream approaches. These two aspects were fully reflected in this year’s conference. They were - flected in the keynote speeches, which covered the background work done starting as early as the early eighties by Barry Boehm, definition of the field by Kent Beck, a successful industrial application in a success story by Sean Hanly, the perspective and the future of agile methods in large corporations by Jack Järkvik, and even some - sightful views from a philosopher, Pekka Himanen.", "title_en": "Extreme Programming and Agile Processes in Software Engineering (vol. # 4044) : 7th International Conference, XP 2006, Oulu, Finland, June 17-22, 2006, Proceedings"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4618499-5", "gnd:4806620-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2006", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

CiE 2006: Logical Approaches to Computational Barriers Swansea, Wales, June 30 - July 5, 2006 Computability in Europe (CiE) is an informal network of European scientists working on computability theory, including its foundations, technical devel- ment, and applications. Among the aims of the network is to advance our t- oretical understanding of what can and cannot be computed, by any means of computation. Its scienti?c vision is broad: computations may be performed with discrete or continuous data by all kinds of algorithms, programs, and - chines. Computations may be made by experimenting with any sort of physical system obeying the laws of a physical theory such as Newtonian mechanics, quantum theory or relativity. Computations may be very general, depending upon the foundations of set theory; or very speci?c, using the combinatorics of ?nite structures. CiE also works on subjects intimately related to computation, especially theories of data and information, and methods for formal reasoning about computations. The sources of new ideas and methods include practical developments in areas such as neural networks, quantum computation, natural computation, molecular computation, and computational learning. Applications are everywhere, especially, in algebra, analysis and geometry, or data types and programming.

Information technology is a rapidly changing field in which researchers and developers must continuously set their vision on the next generation of technologies and the systems that they enable. Suitably, Next-Generation Information Technologies and Systems (NGITS) is an ongoing series of workshops that provides a forum for presenting and discussing the latest advances in information technology. NGITS took are international events held in Israel; previous workshops took place in 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2002. The call for papers for the 2006 workshop was answered by 138 papers on a very diverse range of subjects, thus presenting a considerable challenge to the Program Committee. Each of these papers received professional reviewing from at least three experts, and eventually 32 papers (less than 25%) were selected for presentation at the workshop and inclusion in these proceedings. Of these, 28 are full-length papers and 4 are short papers. In addition, several research works were selected to display “poster” presentations, and a number of research projects exhibited demonstrations. Finally, the workshop featured three keynote lectures by notable experts. The selected papers may be classified roughly in ten broad areas: ? Information systems development ? Distributed systems ? Semi-structured data ? Data mining and agent-oriented computing ? User-oriented design ? Frameworks, models and taxonomies ? Simulation and incremental computing ? Information integration ? Security and privacy ? Next-generation applications This event is the culmination of efforts by many talented and dedicated individuals.

Responding to the Call for Papers, we received 62 papers from 20 different countries, representing six different continents. This clearly indicates the international nature of the ICCS community as well as the widespread interest which was spawned by the previous conferences. By a thorough review process, 24 papers were selected to be included in this volume. In addition, six invited speakers made contributions which can be found in the first section of this volume. The theme of ICCS 2006––Conceptual Structures: Inspiration and Application–– points to a dual focus of interest that is also reflected in the constellation of papers. From the beginning of the planning of this conference, we focused on inspirational sources that have led to the current state of research in our community, by tracing important historical influences which daily effect work in representing knowledge and in handling representations of conceptual structures. At the same time, we also focused on ways in which these legacies are employed to further advance theory and practice in the field of knowledge representation and processing. With this volume, we believe that a valuable contribution to both aspects of this field is being made. We wish to express our appreciation to all the authors of submitted papers, to the members of the Editorial Board and the Program Committee for all their work and valuable comments.

The First International Conference on Digital Rights Management: Technology, Issues, Challenges and Systems (DRMTICS – pronounced ‘dramatics’), took place in Sydney, Australia on 31st October - 2nd November, 2005. It was or- nized by the Centre for Information Security of the University of Wollongong and in cooperation with the International Association of Cryptologic Research (IACR) and IEEE Computer Society’s Task Force on Information Assurance. DRMTICS isan internationalconferenceseriesthat coversthe areaof digital rights management, including research advancements of an applied and theor- ical nature. The goal is to have a broad coverage of the ?eld and related issues and subjects as the area evolves. Since the Internet and the computing infr- tructure has turned into a marketplace for content where information goods of various kinds are exchanged, this area is expected to grow and be part of the ongoing evolution of the information society. The DRM area is a unique blend of many diverse disciplines that include mathematics and cryptography, legal and social aspects, signal processing and watermarking, game theory, infor- tion theory, software and systems design and business analysis, and DRMTICS attempts to cover as much ground as possible, and to cover new results that will further spur new investigations on the foundations and practices of DRM.

The major motivation was to create an event where on-going research e?orts as well as more elaborated, interesting and hi- quality work on applied recon?gurable computing could be presented and d- cussed. Over the last couple of years recon?gurable computing has become a we- known and established research area producing interesting as well as important results in both general and embedded computing systems. It is also getting more and more interest from industry which is attracted by the (design and development) ?exibility as well as the performance improvements that can be expected from this technology. As recon?gurablecomputing has blurred the gap between software and hardware, some even speak of a radical new programming paradigm opening a new realm of unseen applications and opportunities. The logo of the ARC workshop is the Nonius, a measurement instrument used in the Portuguese period of discoveries that was invented by Pedro Nunes, a Portuguesemathematician. As the logo suggests,the main motto of ARC is to help to navigate the world of recon?gurable computing. Driven by this motto, we hope ARC contributes to solid advances on recon?gurable computing.

The field of bioinformatics has two main objectives: the creation and maintenance of biological databases, and the discovery of knowledge from life sciences data in order to unravel the mysteries of biological function, leading to new drugs and therapies for human disease. Life sciences data come in the form of biological sequences, structures, pathways, or literature. One major aspect of discovering biological knowledge is to search, predict, or model specific patterns of a given dataset, which have some relevance to an important biological phenomenon or another dataset. To date, many pattern recognition algorithms have been applied or catered to address a wide range of bioinformatics problems. The 2006 Workshop of Bioinformatics in Pattern Recognition (PRIB 2006) marks the beginning of a series of workshops that is aimed at gathering researchers applying pattern recognition algorithms in an attempt to resolve problems in computational biology and bioinformatics. This volume presents the proceedings of Workshop PRIB 2006 held in Hong Kong, China, on August 20, 2006. It includes 19 technical contributions that were selected by the Program Committee from 43 submissions. We give a brief introduction to pattern recognition in bioinformatics in the first paper. The rest of the volume consists of three parts. Part 1: signal and motif detection, and gene selection. Part 2: models of DNA, RNA, and protein structures.

The origin of the Intelligent Virtual Agents conference dates from a successful workshop on Intelligent Virtual Environments held in Brighton, UK at the 13th European Conference on Arti?cial Intelligence (ECAI’98). This workshop was followed by a second one held in Salford in Manchester, UK in 1999.Subsequent events took place in Madrid, Spain in 2001, Isree, Germany in 2003 and Kos, Greece in 2005. Starting in 2006, Intelligent Virtual Agents moved from being a biennial to an annual event and became a full ?edged international conference, hosted in California.

ICGT 2006 was held in Natal (Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil) on September 17-23, 2006, co-located with the Brazilian Symposium on Formal Methods (SBMF 2006), under the auspices of the BrazilianComputer Society (SBC), the EuropeanAssociation of Software Science and Technology (EASST), the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the IFIP WG 1.3 on Foundations of Systems Speci?cation. The conference obtained partial support from Formal Methods Europe and IFIP TC 1 on Foundations of Computer Science. The scope of the conference concerned graphical structures of various kinds (like graphs, diagrams and visual sentences) that are useful when describing complex structures and systems in a direct and intuitive way. These structures are often enriched with formalisms that model their evolution via suitable kinds of transformations. The ?eld of the conference was concerned with the theory, applications, and implementation issues of such formalisms.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1647320062", "content": {"text": "Extreme Weather Events and Public Health Responses. \"The global climate is changing. During the last 100 years warming has been observed in all continents with an average increase of 0.6 ± 0.2°C (man ± SD) in the course of the 20th century. The greatest temperature changes occurred at middle and high latitudes in the northern hemispheres. The trend towards warmer average surface temperatures for the period since 1976 is roughly three times that of the past 100 years as a whole. In the last decades warming seems to be attributable to human activities (man-made environmental changes) like land-use changes, deforestation, urbanisation and the reduction of wetlands. Global climate change is likely to be accompanied by an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Climate variability occurs at both the level of gradual change as well as the level of extreme events. Extreme weather events are those events which society is unable to cope with. They are by definition rare stochastic events. Europe has experienced on unprecedented rate of extreme weather events in the last 30 years. Heat waves occurred in France, Italy, Portugal, Russian Federation, Hungary and Bulgaria between 2000 and 2003. The annual number of warm extremes increased twice as fast as expected based on the corresponding decrease in the rate of cold extremes. On the other hand cold waves brought serious health problems to Northern Europe, Russian Federation and even Bosnia Herzegovina. In 2002 Romania suffered deleterious windstorms and Public Health responses were necessary. Last but not least, in recent years severe flooding occurred in many European countries like U.K., Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Italy and Germany causing enormous damages, e.g. in August 2002. On the basis of current predictions on climate, more extreme weather events have to be faced in the coming years and they are likely to be more severe. Thus appropriate actions have to be undertaken in order to protect the population and the countries affected. In this book, articles under the following headings are published: \"\"Climate variability and extremes in Europe\"\", \"\"Temperature extremes and health impact\"\", \"\"Response to temperature extremes\"\", \"\"Flooding: the impact on human health\"\", \"\"National case-studying of health care system responses to extreme weather events\"\" and \"\"Recommendations for Public Health responses to extreme weather events\"\".

Summer School held in Cetraro, Italy June 6–11, 2005. Starting in the middle of the 80s, there has been a growing and fruitful interaction between algebraic geometry and certain areas of theoretical high-energy physics, especially the various versions of string theory. Physical heuristics have provided inspiration for new mathematical definitions (such as that of Gromov-Witten invariants) leading in turn to the solution of problems in enumerative geometry. Conversely, the availability of mathematically rigorous definitions and theorems has benefited the physics research by providing the required evidence in fields where experimental testing seems problematic.

This has led public authorities to seek efficiencies, notably through private sector involvement. Support for the sector traditionally seeks to provide basic mobility services to all segments of society, including low-income users. Intervention is also required to manage the natural tendency towards concentration and market power in the provision of these transport services. Policy towards urban public transport is increasingly aimed at managing congestion on the roads and mitigating CO2 emissions by substituting for travel by car. Achieving coherent transport networks that are efficient and financially sustainable is a challenge for any public authority.

The Round Table began with a review of regular interurban coach services based on case studies in countries which had adopted an original approach.

In economic appraisals of road safety measures, determining which method to use for the valuation of those measures is a problem. There are two methods open to us. Remarkably, one accurately measures a non-relevant concept (the human capital method), while the other measures the correct parameter, but not very accurately (the willingness-to-pay method). The Round Table examined the many complementary aspects of the two and found that what was needed, above all, were practical guides for each method. The Round Table noted that values for human life are highly comparable from one mode of transport to another, concluding that this should encourage governments to take charge of safety with the same forcefulness whatever the mode of transport. It also found that spending on road safety was already adequate, but that the money was not 'wisely' spent. Arguably the proposals put forward by this Round Table were unconventional. For instance, it held that difficulties in producing major changes in driver behaviour signalled that more attention should be paid to educational measures and infrastructure investment. This publication reviews the road safety policies and their economic evaluation. At a time when the authorities in many countries are beginning to set still more ambitious targets for those policies, the Round Table highlights the need for measures that are effective over the long term and economically efficient.", "title_en": "Economic Evaluation of Road Traffic Safety Measures"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4062962-4", "gnd:4057931-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5157-3; gnd:2009614-8", "year": "2001", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

With the treatment of waste set to increase -- since the volume of waste is closely related to economic growth -- waste transport will be a major challenge in the future. This raises several issues. Should transport regulations be made more stringent and their implementation reviewed? Should the proximity principle -- incorporated in the regulations in the interests of environmental protection -- be questioned, since it prevents the consolidation of flows in sufficient volume to make the most environmentally-friendly modes of transport viable? The environmental performance of waste transport can be established only within the framework of an overall approach which incorporates all waste treatment routes. We must indeed be wary of seemingly good ideas such as \"waste transport must be restricted\" or \"recycling is the best solution\". The closure of landfills or reprocessing could well lead to a large increase in waste transport. The Round Table picks up on these issues and uses the cases of different countries to examine, in turn, developments in the waste transport sector and the statistical problems encountered in trying to understand them, the regulations applicable to the modes of transport used and their environmental performance, focusing closely on the difficulties created by the current modal split in this sector.", "title_en": "Transport of Waste Products"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4060680-6", "gnd:4000098-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:2009614-8; gnd:5157-3", "year": "2001", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The theme of the conference was \"\"Towards a Service Provision Society\"\". In total, 131 delegates from 34 different countries registered for the conference, making it a truly international event. Papers presented at the conference strongly reflected the conference theme. Of 165 papers submitted, 99 were presented at the conference, representing an acceptance rate of approximately 60%. All papers were peer reviewed by three or four referees (a total of 543 review reports were submitted, corresponding to an average of 3.29 reviews per paper). Over the course of three days, 28 paper sessions were held, covering a range of areas such as: \"\"Information Systems Engineering Management\"\", \"\"Business Systems Analysis Design\"\", \"\"Intelligent Information Systems\"\", \"\"Agile and High-Speed Systems Development Methods\"\", \"\"Enterprise Systems Development Adoption\"\", \"\"Public Information Systems Development\"\", \"\"Information Systems Development Education\"\", \"\"Information Systems Development in Developing Nations\"\", \"\"Legal and Administrative Aspects of Information Systems Development\"\", \"\"Information Systems Research Methodologies\"\", \"\"Service-Oriented Analysis and Design of Information Systems\"\", \"\"IT Service Management\"\", \"\"Philosophical and Theoretical Issues in Information Systems Development\"\", \"\"Model-driven Engineering in ISD\"\", \"\"Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in Information Systems Development\"\". The book is organised by order of the conference sessions. While all the presented papers were of high quality, we have selected two of them to share the Best Paper Award. The first one is: \"\"Modeling the contribution of enterprise architecture practice to the achievement of business goals\"\" by Marlies van Steenbergen Sjaak Brinkkemper. The second one is: \"\"Why can't we bet on ISD Outcomes?: ISD \"\"Form\"\" as a Predictor of Success\"\" by Mike Newman, Shan L Pan Gary Pan. Furthermore, to acknowledge the quality of the reviews he completed, the quality of the paper he submitted, his role as a track and session chair, and his general participation in the conference, we have awarded an Ovreall Contribution Award to Michael Lang of the National University of Ireland, Galway. Details of these awards can be found on the conference Web site at http://isd2008.cs.ucy.ac.cy. Our gratitude is extended firstly to all those who attended and authored work for the conference. The contribution of the International Program Committee was invaluable in identifying track chairs and reviewers to commit to doing vital work. While volunteering to host a conference is a highly personal undertaking, without support it would be impossible. Thus, we wish to thank our sponsors for their financial support and other aid. The ISD conference community has developed over the years a real sense of collegiality and friendliness, perhaps unusually so for a conference. At the same time it has been a stimulating forum where a free exchange of views and perspectives is encouraged. Perhaps what brings the community together is a belief that the process of systems development is important, whether it is systematic or structured or improvised or spontaneous, there is something about the process and the outcomes that excites us. We form a spectrum of thought from those who see the activity as somewhat scientific to others that see it as wholly sociological, we span a divide between abstract and conceptual, to hard code and artefacts - somewhere in-between lies the truth. If our work is to make a meaningful contribution to both practice (by teaching students) and research (by sharing our experiences and studies with others), then hopefully this conference will have done a little of the former and much for the latter. \" This volume constitutes the published proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Information Systems Development.

The 28th International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer ? Science (WG 2002) was held in Cesky ´ Krumlov, a beautiful small town in the southern part of the Czech Republic on the river Vltava (Moldau), June 13–15, 2002. The workshop was organized by the Department of Applied Mathematics of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University in Prague. Since 1975, WG has taken place in Germany 20 times, twice in Austria and The Netherlands, and once in Italy, Slovakia, and Switzerland. As in previous years, the workshop aimed at uniting theory and practice by demonstrating how graph-theoretic concepts can be applied to various areas in Computer Science, or by extracting new problems from applications.The workshop was devoted to the theoretical and practical aspects of graph concepts in computer science, and its contributed talks showed how recent research results from algorithmic graph theory can be used in computer science and which graph-theoretic questions arise from new developments in computer science. Altogether 61 research papers were submitted and reviewed by the program committee. The program committee represented the wide scienti?c spectrum, and in a careful reviewing process with four reports per submission it selected 36papersforpresentationattheworkshop.Thereferees’commentsaswellasthe numerous fruitful discussions during the workshop have been taken into account by the authors of these conference proceedings.

Welcome to the proceedings of the 2003 International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications (ISPA 2003) which was held in Aizu-Wakamatsu City, Japan, July 2–4, 2003. Parallel and distributed processing has become a key technology which will play an important part in determining, or at least shaping, future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches. This inter- tionalsymposiumISPA2003broughttogethercomputerscientistsandengineers, applied mathematicians and researchers to present, discuss and exchange ideas, results, work in progress and experience of research in the area of parallel and distributed computing for problems in science and engineering applications. There were very many paper submissions from 13 countries and regions, - cluding not only Asia and the Paci?c, but also Europe and North America. All submissions were reviewed by at least three program or technical committee members or external reviewers. It was extremely di?cult to select the presen- tions for the symposium because there were so many excellent and interesting ones. In order to allocate as many papers as possible and keep the high quality of the conference, we ?nally decided to accept 39 papers (30 long papers and 9 short papers) for oral technical presentations. We believe all of these papers and topics will not only provide novel ideas, new results, work in progress and state-of-the-art techniques in this ?eld, but will also stimulate future research activities in the area of parallel and distributed processing with applications.", "title_en": "Parallel and Distributed Processing and Applications : International Symposium, ISPA 2003 Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, July 2–4, 2003 Proceedings"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4238872-7", "gnd:4075860-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:124830935; gnd:10059821-3", "year": "2003", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Since 1998, RAID has established its reputation as the main event in research on intrusion detection, both in Europe and the United States. Every year, RAID gathers researchers, security vendors and security practitioners to listen to the most recent research results in the area as well as experiments and deployment issues. This year, RAID has grown one step further to establish itself as a well-known event in the security community, with the publication of hardcopy proceedings. RAID 2000 received 26 paper submissions from 10 countries and 3 continents. The program committee selected 14 papers for publication and examined 6 of them for presentation. In addition RAID 2000 received 30 extended abstracts proposals; 15 of these extended abstracts were accepted for presentation. - tended abstracts are available on the website of the RAID symposium series, http://www.raid-symposium.org/. We would like to thank the technical p- gram committee for the help we received in reviewing the papers, as well as all the authors for their participation and submissions, even for those rejected. As in previous RAID symposiums, the program alternates between fun- mental research issues, such as newtechnologies for intrusion detection, and more practical issues linked to the deployment and operation of intrusion det- tion systems in a real environment. Five sessions have been devoted to intrusion detection technology, including modeling, data mining and advanced techniques.

Modern software systems are becoming more complex in many ways and have to cope with a growing number of abnormal situations which, in turn, are increasingly complex to handle. The most general way of dealing with these problems is by incorporating exception handling techniques in software design. In the past, various exception handling models and techniques have been proposed and many of them are part of practical languages and software composition technologies. This book is composed of five parts, which deal with topics related to exception handling in the context of programming language models, design methodologies, concurrent and distributed systems, applications and experiences, and large-scale systems such as database and workflow process mangagement systems.

This monograph is an excellent example of such an interdisciplinary approach that brings together database knowledge rarely concerned with agents, and agent techniques that have had little to do with database technology", "title_en": "Transactional Agents : Towards a Robust Multi-Agent System"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4126481-2", "gnd:4195506-7", "gnd:4389058-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Nagi, Khaled", "year": "2001", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This textbook is intended to give an introduction to and an overview of sta- of-the-art techniques in the design of complex embedded systems. The book title is SAMOS for two major reasons. First, it tries to focus on the actual distinct, yet important problem ?elds of System-Level design of embedded systems, including mapping techniques and synthesis,Architectural design,Modeling issues such as speci?cation languages, formal models, and- nallySimulation. The second reason is that the volume includes a number of papers presented at a workshop with the same name on the Island of Samos, Greece, in July 2001. In order to receive international attention, a number of reputed researchers were invited to this workshop to present their current work. Participation was by invitation only. For the volume presented here, a number of additional papers where selected based on a call for papers. All contributions were refereed. This volume presents a selection of 18 of the refereed papers, including 2 invited papers. The textbook is organized according to four topics: The ?rst isA)System- LevelDesignandSimulation.Inthissection,wepresentacollectionofpapers that give an overview of the challenging goal to design and explore alternatives of embedded system implementations at the system-level. One paper gives an overview of models and tools used in system-level design.

Middleware is everywhere. Ever since the advent of sockets and other virtu- circuit abstractions, researchers have been looking for ways to incorporate high- value concepts into distributed systems platforms. Most distributed applications, especially Internet applications, are now programmed using such middleware platforms. Prior to 1998, there were several major conferences and workshops at which research into middleware was reported, including ICODP (International C- ference on Open Distributed Processing), ICDP (International Conference on Distributed Platforms) and SDNE (Services in Distributed and Networked - vironments). Middleware’98was a synthesis of these three conferences. Middleware 2000 continued the excellent tradition of Middleware’98. It p- vided a single venue for reporting state-of-the-art results in the provision of distributed systems platforms. The focus of Middleware 2000 was the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of distributed systems platforms and architectures for future networked environments. Among the 70 initial submissions to Middleware 2000, 21 papers were - lected for inclusion in the technical program of the conference. Every paper was reviewed by four members of the program committee. The papers were judged - cording to their originality, presentation quality, and relevance to the conference topics. The accepted papers cover various subjects such as caching, re?ection, quality of service, and transactions.

The increasingly active eld of Evolutionary Computation (EC) provides val- ble tools, inspired by the theory of natural selection and genetic inheritance, to problem solving, machine learning, and optimization in many real-world app- cations. Despite some early intuitions about EC, that can be dated back to the - vention of computers, and a better formal de nition of EC, made in the 1960s, the quest for real-world applications of EC only began in the late 1980s. The dramatic increase in computer performances in the last decade of the 20th c- tury gave rise to a positive feedback process: EC techniques became more and more applicable, stimulating the growth of interest in their study, and allowing, in turn, new powerful EC paradigms to be devised. In parallel with new theoretical results, the number of elds to which EC is being applied is increasing day by day, along with the complexity of applications and application domains. In particular, industrially relevant elds, such as signal and image processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, industrial control, telecommunication, scheduling and timetabling, and aerospace engineering are employing EC techniques to solve complex real-world problems.

Database research and development has been remarkably successful over the past three decades. Now the field is facing new challenges posted by the rapid advances of technology, especially the penetration of the Web and Internet into everyone's daily life. The economical and financial environment where database systems are used has been changing dramatically. In addition to being able to efficiently manage a large volume of operational data generated internally, the ability to manage data in cyberspace, extract relevant information, and discover knowledge to support decision making is critical to the success of any organization. In order to provide researchers and practitioners with a forum to share their experiences in tackling problems in managing and using data, information, and knowledge in the age of the Internet and Web, the First International Conference on Web-Age Information Management (WAIM 2000) was held in Shanghai, China, June 21-23. The inaugural conference in its series was well received. Researchers from 17 countries and regions, including Austria, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, The Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, UK, and USA submitted their recent work. Twenty-seven regular and 14 short papers contained in these proceedings were presented during the two-day conference. These papers cover a large spectrum of issues, from classical data management such as object-oriented modeling, spatial and temporal databases to recent hits like data mining, data warehousing, semi-structured data, and XML.", "title_en": "Web-Age Information Management : First International Conference, WAIM 2000 Shanghai, China, June 21–23, 2000 Proceedings"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4363898-3", "gnd:4546354-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Lu, Hongjun", "year": "2000", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The Pernambuco School on Software Engineering (PSSE) 2007 was the second in a series of events devoted to the study of advanced computer science and to the promotion of international scienti?c collaboration. The main theme in 2007 was testing. Testing is nowadays a key activity for assuring software quality. The summer school and its proceedings were intended to give a detailed tutorial introduction to the scienti?c basis of this activity and its state of the art. Theseproceedingsrecordthecontributionsfromtheinvitedlecturers.Eachof thechaptersistheresultofathoroughrevisionoftheinitialnotesprovidedtothe participants of the school. The revision was inspired by the synergy generated by the opportunity for the lecturers to present and discuss their work among themselves and with the school’s attendees. The editors have tried to produce a coherent view of the topic by harmonizing these contributions, smoothing out di?erences in notation and approach, and providing links between the lectures. We apologize to the authors for any errors introduced by our extensive editing. Although the chapters are linked in severalways, each one is su?ciently se- contained to be read in isolation. Nevertheless, Chap. 1 should be read ?rst by those interested in an introduction to testing. Chapter 1 introduces the terminology adopted in this book. It also provides an overview of the testing process, and of the types (functional, structural, and so on)anddimensions(unit,integration,andsoon)ofthetestingactivity.Themain strategies employed in the central activity of test selection are also discussed.

The Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) and the Bavarian Competence Network for Technical and Scienti?c High Performance Computing (KONWIHR) publish in the present book results of numerical simulations facilitated by the High P- formance Computer System in Bavaria (HLRB II) within the last two years. The papers were presented at the Fourth Joint HLRB and KONWIHR Review and - sult Workshop in Garching on 8th and 9th December 2009, and were selected from all progress reports of projects that use the HLRB II. Similar to the workshop two years ago, the majority of the contributed papers belong to the area of computational ?uid dynamics (CFD), condensed matter physics, astrophysics, chemistry, computer sciences and high-energy physics. We note a considerable increase of the user c- munity in some areas: Compared to 2007, the number of papers increased from 6 to 12 in condensed matter physics and from 2 to 5 in high-energy physics. Bio s- ences contributed only one paper in 2007, but four papers in 2009. This indicates that the area of application of supercomputers is continuously growing and entering new ?elds of research. The year 2007 saw two major events of particular importance for the LRZ. First, after a substantial upgrade with dual-core processors the SGI Altix 4700 superc- puter reached a peak performance of more than 62 Tera?op/s.

Ramsey theory is a relatively “new,” approximately 100 year-old direction of fascinating mathematical thought that touches on many classic fields of mathematics such as combinatorics, number theory, geometry, ergodic theory, topology, combinatorial geometry, set theory, and measure theory. Ramsey theory possesses its own unifying ideas, and some of its results are among the most beautiful theorems of mathematics. The underlying theme of Ramsey theory can be formulated as: any finite coloring of a large enough system contains a monochromatic subsystem of higher degree of organization than the system itself, or as T.S. Motzkin famously put it, absolute disorder is impossible. Ramsey Theory: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow explores the theory’s history, recent developments, and some promising future directions through invited surveys written by prominent researchers in the field. The first three surveys provide historical background on the subject; the last three address Euclidean Ramsey theory and related coloring problems. In addition, open problems posed throughout the volume and in the concluding open problem chapter will appeal to graduate students and mathematicians alike. Contributors: J. Burkert, A. Dudek, R.L.

Therefore it was impossible to split the papers into generic groups which is why they are presented in alphabetic order. However they mainly concern : texture analysis (5 papers) with different techniques (variational analysis, wavelet and morphological component analysis, fractional Brownian fields), geometrical methods (2 papers ) for restoration and invariant feature detection, classification (with multifractal analysis), neurosciences imaging and analysis of Multi-Valued Images.

Such phenomena appear in the fields of finance, telecommunications, economics, biology, geology, demography, physics, chemistry, signal processing and modern control theory, to mention just a few. As this book emphasizes the importance of numerical and theoretical studies of the stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes, it will be useful for a wide spectrum of researchers in applied probability, stochastic numerical and theoretical analysis and statistics, as well as for graduate students. To make it more complete and accessible for graduate students, practitioners and researchers, the editors Mounir Zili and Daria Filatova have included a survey dedicated to the basic concepts of numerical analysis of the stochastic differential equations, written by Henri Schurz.", "title_en": "Stochastic Differential Equations and Processes : SAAP, Tunisia, October 7-9, 2010"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4057621-8", "gnd:4057630-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Zili, Mounir", "year": "2012", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Mathematical Methods for Signal and Image Analysis and Representation presents the mathematical methodology for generic image analysis tasks. In the context of this book an image may be any m-dimensional empirical signal living on an n-dimensional smooth manifold (typically, but not necessarily, a subset of spacetime). The existing literature on image methodology is rather scattered and often limited to either a deterministic or a statistical point of view. In contrast, this book brings together these seemingly different points of view in order to stress their conceptual relations and formal analogies. Furthermore, it does not focus on specific applications, although some are detailed for the sake of illustration, but on the methodological frameworks on which such applications are built, making it an ideal companion for those seeking a rigorous methodological basis for specific algorithms as well as for those interested in the fundamental methodology per se. Covering many topics at the forefront of current research, including anisotropic diffusion filtering of tensor fields, this book will be of particular interest to graduate and postgraduate students and researchers in the fields of computer vision, medical imaging and visual perception.

Many research studies in the social and economic fields regard the collection and analysis of large amounts of data. These data sets vary in their nature and complexity, they may be one-off or repeated, they may be hierarchical, spatial or temporal. Examples include textual data, transaction-based data, medical data and financial time-series. Standard statistical techniques are usually not well suited to manage this type of data and many authors have proposed extensions of classical techniques or completely new methods. The huge size of these data-sets and their complexity require new strategies of analysis sometimes subsumed under the terms “data mining” or “predictive analytics”.

Lake Baikal is the oldest lake and largest freshwater reservoir in the world. As a result of its exceptionally long geological history, the lake has been a theatre of evolution and speciation of organisms, and it currently harbors more species than any other lake in the world. Based on its unique nature, Lake Baikal was recently designated a World Heritage site and is regarded as a hotspot for evolution, speciation, and biodiversity. With its tremendously peculiar biota, Lake Baikal is now awaiting modern analytical approaches to the profound problems of speciation and evolution. In late autumn 1998 a symposium was held in Japan with the theme \"Lake Baikal: A mirror in time and space for understanding global change processes\" to bring together scientists from different disciplines who are studying Lake Baikal. Three international scientific associations: The BICER (Baikal International Center for Ecological Research), BDP (Baikal Drilling Project), and DIWPA (Diversitas Western Pacific and Asia) were involved in the organisation.

This publication presents the current situation with regard to the magnitude and economic impact of migrants’ remittances to their countries of origin. In 2004, remittances exceeded official development aid in several emigration countries: they totalled USD 126 billion according to IMF estimates. The book surveys the channels used to collect these funds; the role of banking systems and other financial institutions; the introduction of new technologies and their impact on fund collection; how the funds are transferred; and how to reduce the costs.

Hydrogen has the potential to play an important role as a sustainable and environmentally acceptable energy carrier in the 21st century. Since natural sources of pure hydrogen are extremely limited, it is necessary to develop technologies to produce large quantities of hydrogen economically. The currently dominant technology for producing hydrogen is based on reforming fossil fuels, a process which releases greenhouse gases. Hydrogen produced by water cracking, using heat and surplus electricity from nuclear power plants, requires no fossil fuels and results in lower greenhouse gas emissions.

New developments are presented in this volume and thestatus of research is reviewed. A major focus is put on nuclear structure physics, dealing with superheavy elements and with various forms of exotic nuclei: strange nuclei, very neutron rich nuclei, nuclei of antimatter. Also quantum electrodynamics of strong fields is addressed, which is linked to the occurrence of giant nuclear systems in, e.g., U+U collisions. At high energies nuclear physics joins with elementary particle physics. Various chapters address the theory ofelementary matter at high densities and temperature, in particular the quark gluon plasma which is predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to occur in high-energy heavy ion collisions. In the field of nuclearastrophysics, the properties of neutron stars and quark stars are discussed.

Ion Correlations at Electrified Soft Matter Interfaces presents an investigation that combines experiments, theory, and computer simulations to demonstrate that the interdependency between ion correlations and other ion interactions in solution can explain the distribution of ions near an electrified liquid/liquid interface. The properties of this interface are exploited to vary the coupling strength of ion-ion correlations from weak to strong while monitoring their influence on ion distributions at the nanometer scale with X-ray reflectivity and on the macroscopic scale with interfacial tension measurements. This thesis demonstrates that a parameter-free density functional theory that includes ion-ion correlations and ion-solvent interactions is in agreement with the data over the entire range of experimentally tunable correlation coupling strengths. The reported findings represent a significant advance towards understanding the nature and role of ion correlations in charged soft-matter. Ion distributions underlie many scientific phenomena and technological applications, including electrostatic interactions between charged biomolecules and the efficiency of energy storage devices. These distributions are determined by interactions dictated by the chemical properties of the ions and their environment, as well as the long-range nature of the electrostatic force. The presence of strong correlations between ions is responsible for counterintuitive effects such as like-charge attraction", "title_en": "Ion Correlations at Electrified Soft Matter Interfaces"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4162355-1", "gnd:4609142-7", "gnd:4021991-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Laanait, Nouamane", "year": "2013", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1653045310", "content": {"text": "Magnetic Resonance Detection of Explosives and Illicit Materials. Detection of concealed explosives is a notoriously difficult problem, and many different approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) is unique in many ways. It operates in a safe AM radio frequency range, and it can remotely detect unique “fingerprint” (NQR spectrum) of many explosives, such as TNT or RDX. As such, the detection of target does not depend on the shape or material of the container, or the presence of metallic object such as triggers etc. Spectra of chemically similar compounds differ enough that their presence never causes interference or false alarms. Unfortunately, widespread use is prevented due to low sensitivity, radiofrequency interference from the noisy environment, and inability to detect liquid explosives. This book presents current state of the art of the attempts to overcome NQR sensitivity problem, either by increasing the strengths of signals generated, or by increasing the specificity of the technique through a better understanding of the factors that affect the quadrupolar parameters of specific explosives. The use of these specific quadrupolar parameters is demonstrated on signal processing techniques that can detect weak signals, which are hidden in a noisy background. The problem of differentiation of liquid explosives and benign liquids in closed containers is approached by measurements of different nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters. As shown, a couple of solutions has reached a prototype stage and could find their use in a near future", "title_en": "Magnetic Resonance Detection of Explosives and Illicit Materials"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4075421-2", "gnd:4016013-0", "gnd:4172114-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Apih, Tomaž", "year": "2014", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Main description: This volume represents some of the Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Research Committee on Development Economics (Ausschuss für Entwicklungsländer) of the German Economic Association (Verein für Socialpolitik) held in Cologne, Germany, in July 2004. The meeting focused on the effectiveness of, and new approaches in, development cooperation. Both issues have become increasingly important in recent years in view of the declining volume of budget funds allocated to development cooperation. -- The papers discussing the effectiveness of foreign aid shed new light on the issue at a crucial moment where economists have begun to question the recent consensus that the productivity of aid mainly depends on the recipient country's policy environment. As far as the contributions dealing with new approaches in development cooperation are concerned, these are centred on a closer integration of the private sector, by joint action with so-called lead firms in production networks on the one hand, and the mobilization of additional financial resources from international capital markets for bilateral development cooperation, on the other. The authors also make suggestions concerning critical aspects relevant for implementation.

This book reviews the phenomenology displayed by relativistic jets as well as the most recent theoretical efforts to understand the physical mechanisms at their origin. Relativistic jets have been observed and studied in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) for about half a century and are believed to be fueled by accretion onto a supermassive black hole at the center of the host galaxy. Since the first discovery of relativistic jets associated with so-called \"micro-quasars\" much more recently, it has seemed clear that much of the physics governing the relativistic outflows in stellar X-ray binaries harboring black holes and in AGN must be common, but acting on very different spatial and temporal scales. With new observational and theoretical results piling up every day, this book attempts to synthesize a consistent, unified physical picture of the formation and disruption of jets in accreting black-hole systems. The chapters in this book offer overviews accessible not only to specialists but also to graduate students and astrophysicists working in other areas.

Bridges among diverse mathematical threads and extensive applications make this an invaluable source for understanding both the current state of the art and future directions. The existence of Hadamard matrices remains one of the most challenging open questions in combinatorics. Substantial progress on their existence has resulted from advances in algebraic design theory using deep connections with linear algebra, abstract algebra, finite geometry, number theory, and combinatorics. Hadamard matrices arise in a very diverse set of applications.

This volume contains expanded versions of lectures given at an instructional conference on number theory and arithmetic geometry held August 9 through 18, 1995 at Boston University. Contributor's includeThe purpose of the conference, and of this book, is to introduce and explain the many ideas and techniques used by Wiles in his proof that every (semi-stable) elliptic curve over Q is modular, and to explain how Wiles' result can be combined with Ribet's theorem and ideas of Frey and Serre to show, at long last, that Fermat's Last Theorem is true. The book begins with an overview of the complete proof, followed by several introductory chapters surveying the basic theory of elliptic curves, modular functions, modular curves, Galois cohomology, and finite group schemes. Representation theory, which lies at the core of Wiles' proof, is dealt with in a chapter on automorphic representations and the Langlands-Tunnell theorem, and this is followed by in-depth discussions of Serre's conjectures, Galois deformations, universal deformation rings, Hecke algebras, complete intersections and more, as the reader is led step-by-step through Wiles' proof. In recognition of the historical significance of Fermat's Last Theorem, the volume concludes by looking both forward and backward in time, reflecting on the history of the problem, while placing Wiles' theorem into a more general Diophantine context suggesting future applications.

In recent years there has been increasing interaction among various branches of mathematics. This is especially evident in the theory of several complex variables where fruitful interplays of the methods of algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and partial differential equations have led to unexpected insights and new directions of research. In China there has been a long tradition of study in complex analysis, differential geometry and differential equations as interrelated subjects due to the influence of Professors S. S. Chern and L. K. Hua. After a long period of isolation, in recent years there is a resurgence of scientific activity and a resumption of scientific exchange with other countries. The Hangzhou conference is the first international conference in several complex variables held in China. It offered a good opportunity for mathematicians from China, U.S., Germany, Japan, Canada, and France to meet and to discuss their work. The papers presented in the conference encompass all major aspects of several complex variables, in particular, in such areas as complex differential geometry, integral representation, boundary behavior of holomorphic functions, invariant metrics, holomorphic vector bundles, and pseudoconvexity. Most of the participants wrote up their talks for these proceedings. Some of the papers are surveys and the others present original results.

Specifically, the five courses dealt with an assessment of recent results on the optimal transportation problem, the numerical approximation of moving fronts evolving by mean curvature, the dynamics of patterns and interfaces in some reaction-diffusion systems with chemical-biological applications, evolutionary free boundary problems of parabolic type or for Navier-Stokes equations, and a variational approach to evolution problems for the Ginzburg-Landau functional", "title_en": "Mathematical Aspects of Evolving Interfaces : Lectures given at the C.I.M.-C.I.M.E. joint Euro-Summer School held in Madeira, Funchal, Portugal, July 3-9, 2000"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4114528-8", "gnd:4021991-4", "gnd:4048395-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:133791408", "year": "2003", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The geometric approach to the algebraic theory of quadratic forms is the study of projective quadrics over arbitrary fields. Function fields of quadrics have been central to the proofs of fundamental results since the renewal of the theory by Pfister in the 1960's. Recently, more refined geometric tools have been brought to bear on this topic, such as Chow groups and motives, and have produced remarkable advances on a number of outstanding problems. Several aspects of these new methods are addressed in this volume, which includes - an introduction to motives of quadrics by Alexander Vishik, with various applications, notably to the splitting patterns of quadratic forms under base field extensions; - papers by Oleg Izhboldin and Nikita Karpenko on Chow groups of quadrics and their stable birational equivalence, with application to the construction of fields which carry anisotropic quadratic forms of dimension 9, but none of higher dimension; - a contribution in French by Bruno Kahn which lays out a general framework for the computation of the unramified cohomology groups of quadrics and other cellular varieties.

In its classical form, web geometry consists in the study of webs up to local diffeomorphisms. A significant part of the theory revolves around the concept of abelian relation, a particular kind of functional relation among the first integrals of the foliations of a web.

The book offers complete proofs of both Chern’s bound and Trépreau’s algebraization theorem, including all the necessary prerequisites that go beyond elementary complex analysis or basic algebraic geometry.

This book is devoted to current advances in the field of nonlinear mathematical physics and modeling of critical phenomena that can lead to catastrophic events. Pursuing a multidisciplinary approach, it gathers the work of scientists who are developing mathematical and computational methods for the study and analysis of nonlinear phenomena and who are working actively to apply these tools and create conditions to mitigate and reduce the negative consequences of natural and socio-economic disaster risk. This book summarizes the contributions of the International School and Workshop on Nonlinear Mathematical Physics and Natural Hazards, organized within the framework of the South East Europe Network in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics (SEENET MTP) and supported by UNESCO. It was held at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences from November 28 to December 2, 2013. The contributions are divided into two major parts in keeping with the scientific program of the meeting. Among the topics covered in Part I (Nonlinear Mathematical Physics towards Critical Phenomena) are predictions and correlations in self organized criticality, space-time structure of extreme current and activity events in exclusion processes, quantum spin chains and integrability of many-body systems, applications of discriminantly separable polynomials, MKdV-type equations, and chaotic behavior in Yang-Mills theories. Part II (Seismic Hazard and Risk) is devoted to probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, seismic risk mapping, seismic monitoring, networking and data processing in Europe, mainly in South-East Europe. The book aims to promote collaboration at the regional and European level to better understand and model phenomena that can cause natural and socio-economic disasters, and to contribute to the joint efforts to mitigate the negative consequence of natural disasters. This collection of papers reflects contemporary efforts on capacity building through developing skills, exchanging knowledge and practicing mathematical methods for modeling nonlinear phenomena, disaster risk preparedness and natural hazards mitigation. The target audience includes students and researchers in mathematical and theoretical physics, earth physics, applied physics, geophysics, seismology and earthquake danger and risk mitigation", "title_en": "Nonlinear Mathematical Physics and Natural Hazards : Selected Papers from the International School and Workshop held in Sofia, Bulgaria, 28 November – 02 December, 2013"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4041387-1", "gnd:4165788-3", "gnd:4136065-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Aneva, Boyka", "year": "2015", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This comprehensive book highlights soft computing and geostatistics applications in hydrocarbon exploration and production, combining practical and theoretical aspects. It spans a wide spectrum of applications in the oil industry, crossing many discipline boundaries such as geophysics, geology, petrophysics and reservoir engineering. It is complemented by several tutorial chapters on fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms and geostatistics to introduce these concepts to the uninitiated. The application areas include prediction of reservoir properties (porosity, sand thickness, lithology, fluid), seismic processing, seismic and bio stratigraphy, time lapse seismic and core analysis. There is a good balance between introducing soft computing and geostatistics methodologies that are not routinely used in the petroleum industry and various applications areas. The book can be used by many practitioners such as processing geophysicists, seismic interpreters, geologists, reservoir engineers, petrophysicist, geostatistians, asset mangers and technology application professionals. It will also be of interest to academics to assess the importance of, and contribute to, R & D efforts in relevant areas", "title_en": "Soft computing and intelligent data analysis in oil exploration"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4226127-2", "gnd:4125182-9", "gnd:4455833-8", "gnd:4047505-0", "gnd:4152692-2", "gnd:4131193-0", "gnd:4359501-7", "gnd:4033447-8", "gnd:4152663-6", "gnd:4020279-3", "gnd:4120666-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2003", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Kolmogorov equations are second order parabolic equations with a finite or an infinite number of variables. They are deeply connected with stochastic differential equations in finite or infinite dimensional spaces. They arise in many fields as Mathematical Physics, Chemistry and Mathematical Finance. These equations can be studied both by probabilistic and by analytic methods, using such tools as Gaussian measures, Dirichlet Forms, and stochastic calculus. The following courses have been delivered: N.V. Krylov presented Kolmogorov equations coming from finite-dimensional equations, giving existence, uniqueness and regularity results. M. Röckner has presented an approach to Kolmogorov equations in infinite dimensions, based on an LP-analysis of the corresponding diffusion operators with respect to suitably chosen measures. J. Zabczyk started from classical results of L. Gross, on the heat equation in infinite dimension, and discussed some recent results", "title_en": "Stochastic PDE’s and Kolmogorov Equations in Infinite Dimensions : Lectures given at the 2nd Session of the Centro Internazionale Matematico Estivo (C.I.M.E.) held in Cetraro, Italy, August 24-September 1, 1998"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4135969-0", "gnd:4164698-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:121699684", "year": "1999", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This is yet another indispensable volume for all probabilists and collectors of the Saint-Flour series, and is also of great interest for mathematical physicists. It contains two of the three lecture courses given at the 32nd Probability Summer School in Saint-Flour (July 7-24, 2002). Boris Tsirelson's lectures introduce the notion of nonclassical noise produced by very nonlinear functions of many independent random variables, for instance singular stochastic flows or oriented percolation. Two examples are examined (noise made by a Poisson snake, the Brownian web). A new framework for the scaling limit is proposed, as well as old and new results about noises, stability, and spectral measures. Wendelin Werner's contribution gives a survey of results on conformal invariance, scaling limits and properties of some two-dimensional random curves. It provides a definition and properties of the Schramm-Loewner evolutions, computations (probabilities, critical exponents), the relation with critical exponents of planar Brownian motions, planar self-avoiding walks, critical percolation, loop-erased random walks and uniform spanning trees", "title_en": "Lectures on Probability Theory and Statistics : Ecole d’Eté de Probabilités de Saint-Flour XXXII - 2002"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4056995-0", "gnd:4079013-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Tsirelson, Boris", "year": "2004", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

There has been much recent progress in global optimization algorithms for nonconvex continuous and discrete problems from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. Convex analysis plays a fundamental role in the analysis and development of global optimization algorithms. This is due to the fact that virtually all nonconvex optimization problems can be described using differences of convex functions and differences of convex sets. A conference on Convex Analysis and Global Optimization was held June 5-9, 2000 at Pythagorian, Samos, Greece. It was in honor of the memory of C. Caratheodory (1873-1950). It was endorsed by the Mathematical Programming Society (MPS) and by the Society for industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAN) Activity Group in Optimization. This volume contains a selection of refereed papers based on invited and contributing talks presented at the conference. The two themes of convexity and global optimization pervade the book. The conference provided a forum for researchers working on different aspects of convexity and global optimization to present their recent discoveries, and to interact with people working on complementary aspects of mathematical programming.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1655418327", "content": {"text": "Dynamic Meteorology: Data Assimilation Methods. One of the main reasons we cannot tell what the weather will be tomorrow is that we do not know accurately enough what the weather is today. Mathematically speaking, numerical weather prediction (NWP) is an initial-value problem for a system of nonlinear partial differential equations in which the necessary initial values are known only incompletely and inaccurately. Data at the initial time of a numerical forecast can be supplemented, however, by observations of the atmos­ phere over a time interval preceding it. New observing systems, in particular polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites, which are providing observations continuously in time, make is absolutely necess­ ary to find new and more satisfactory methods of assimilating meteorological observations - for the dual purpose of defining atmospheric states and of issuing forecasts from the states thus defined. FUndamental progress in this area has been made in recent years and this book attempts to give a review and some suggestions for further improvements in the field of meteorological data assimila­ tion methods. The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) every year organises seminars for the benefit of meteorologists and geophysicists of the ECMWF Member states. The 1980 Seminar was devoted to data assimilation methods, and this book contains selected lectures from that seminar. The purpose of the seminar was twofold: it was intended to give a basic introduction to the subject, as well as an overview of the latest developments in the field.

This volume constitutes the Proceedings of the joint meeting of GLIM89 and the 4th International Workshop on statistical Modelling, held in Trento, Italy, from 17 to 21 July 1989. The meeting aimed to bring together researchers interested in the development and application of generalized linear modelling in GLIM and those interested in statistical modelling in its widest sense. This joint meeting built upon the success of previous workshops held in Innsbruck, perugia and Vienna, and upon the two previous GLIM conferences , GLIM82 and GLIM85. The Proceedings of the latter two being available as numbers 14 and 32 in the springer Verlag series of Lecture Notes in Statistics). Much statistical modelling is carried out using GLIM, as is apparent from many of the papers in these Proceedings; however, the Programme Committee were also keen on encouraging papers which discussed more general modelling techniques. Thus about a third of the papers in this volume are outside the GLIM framework. The Programme Committee specifically requested non-theoretical papers in addition to considering theoretical contributions. Thus there are papers in a wide range of practical areas, such as radio spectral occupancy, comparison of birthweights, intervals between births, accidents of railway workers, genetics, demography, medical trials, the social sciences and insurance. A wide range of theoretical developments are discussed, for example, overdispersion, non-exponential family modelling, novel approaches to analysing contingency tables, random effects models, Kalman Filtering, model checking and extensions of Wedderburn's theoretical underpinning of GLMs.", "title_en": "Statistical Modelling : Proceedings of GLIM 89 and the 4th International Workshop on Statistical Modelling held in Trento, Italy, July 17–21, 1989"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4121722-6", "gnd:4021281-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Decarli, Adriano", "year": "1989", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The genesis of this volume was in a one-day meeting arranged under the auspices of the Nathematical Ecology Group, jointly of the British Region of the Biometric Society and the British Ecological Society, and held in the Natural History Museum in London on the 4th May 1982. The object of the meeting was to bring together individuals from different dis­ ciplines but with a common interest in ornithology. In this volume we have tried to preserve the flavour of the meeting so that all but two of the papers read or pre­ sented as posters can be found here. The two papers that have not been included have since been published elsewhere: see Birkhead and Nettleship (1983) and Cav~ (1983). Further papers have been added to the volume from contributors who were unable to attend the London meeting, or were unable to present a paper there. All of the papers were refereed by ourselves. A volume which contains papers by both statisticians and non-statisticians is inevitably going to be variable with regard to the depth and range of statistical techniques used. Thus non-statisticians are likely to find some of the papers written by statisticians difficult at times, and conversely statisticians n2Y find that they would have treated some problems differently from non-statisticians. It is hoped, however, that this volun~ will increase awareness of the interests and problems (including solutions), in the general area of ornithology, and stimulate cross-fertilisation of ideas.", "title_en": "Statistics in Ornithology"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4056995-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Morgan, Byron J.

Faced with this inflation. applied statisticians feel more and more un­ comfortable: they are often hesitant about their traditional (typically parametric) assumptions. such as normal and i. i. d . • ARMA forms for time-series. etc . • but are at the same time afraid of venturing into the jungle of less familiar models. The prob­ lem of the justification for taking up one model rather than another one is thus a crucial one. and can take different forms. (a) ~~~£ifi~~~iQ~ : Do observations suggest the use of a different model from the one initially proposed (e. g. one which takes account of outliers). or do they render plau­ sible a choice from among different proposed models (e. g. fixing or not the value of a certai n parameter) ? (b) tlQ~~L~~l!rQ1!iIMHQ~ : How is it possible to compute a \"distance\" between a given model and a less (or more) sophisticated one. and what is the technical meaning of such a \"distance\" ? (c) BQe~~~~~~ : To what extent do the qualities of a procedure. well adapted to a \"small\" model. deteriorate when this model is replaced by a more general one? This question can be considered not only. as usual. in a parametric framework (contamina­ tion) or in the extension from parametriC to non parametric models but also. 1.

In its broadest sense, nonlinear synthesis involves in fact the synthesis of sometimes so­ phisticated or complex control strategies with the aim of prescribing, or at least influencing, the evolution of complex nonlinear systems. Nonlinear synthesis requires the development of methodologies for modeling complex systems, for the analysis of nonlinear models, and for the systematic design of control schemes or feedback laws which can achieve a wide variety of prescribed objectives. The modeling, analysis and control of complex systems in the face of uncertainty form on of the major components of the current research program in the Department of Systems and Decision Sciences (SDS) at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). In June 1989, a IIASA workshop on Nonlinear Synthesis, sponsored by SDS, was held in Sopron, Hungary. We are proud to present this volume as the proceedings of this workshop, a workshop attened by prominent researchers in nonlinear systems from both the East and the West.

The ongoing crisis in Europe has dramatic impact on the life in many Southern European cities: Unemployment, social deprivation, poverty, political instability, severe cuts in the welfare state budgets and a wide spread feeling of despair have eroded much of the social foundation of the cities.In this book, contributors from Spain, Greece, Portugal and Italy provide an insight into the complex interference between the different aspects of the crisis. They show that the recent urban crisis is not purely a result of the budgetary problems of the nation state (»austerity urbanism«) but needs to be seen as multiple contestations.

This entails many new demands on administrative bodies and has led to considerable implementation problems. There is a cross-level implementation system of a substantial institutional and procedural complexity. The problems of administrative action were initially barely discussed. In the meantime, however, the discussion has intensified. In addition, the Federal Agency of Migration and Refugees, the Federal Labour Office and the federal states have begun to reform the existing administrative implementation system, and there are innovative approaches in the area of integration on a municipal level. The present volume draws up an interim balance on administrative action in the context of the refugee crisis and offers institutional strategies for addressing it for various federal levels. It includes analyses of implementation options and problems from administrative science and practice, as well as an outlook on future challenges.With contributions byProf. Dr. Nathalie Behnke, Rainer Beutel, Jörg Bogumil, Jonas Hafner, M.A., Prof. Dr. Thurid Hustedt, Prof. Dr. Sabine Kuhlmann, Prof. Dr. Isabella Proeller, Ina Radtke, M.Sc., Prof. Dr. Hannes Schammann, Dorothea Störr-Ritter, Christoph Verenkotte Im Zuge der Flüchtlingskrise sind über 1,4 Mio.

Successful simulation of turbulence requires the understanding of the complex physical phenomena involved and suitable models for describing the turbulent momentum, heat and mass transfer. For the understanding of turbulence phenomena, experiments are indispensable, but they are equally important for providing data for the development and testing of turbulence models and hence for CFD software validation.

Distinguishing chaoticity from regularity in deterministic dynamical systems and specifying the subspace of the phase space in which instabilities are expected to occur is of utmost importance in as disparate areas as astronomy, particle physics and climate dynamics. To address these issues there exists a plethora of methods for chaos detection and predictability. The most commonly employed technique for investigating chaotic dynamics, i.e. the computation of Lyapunov exponents, however, may suffer a number of problems and drawbacks, for example when applied to noisy experimental data. In the last two decades, several novel methods have been developed for the fast and reliable determination of the regular or chaotic nature of orbits, aimed at overcoming the shortcomings of more traditional techniques. This set of lecture notes and tutorial reviews serves as an introduction to and overview of modern chaos detection and predictability techniques for graduate students and non-specialists.

The mapping of the surface of stars requires diverse skills, analysis techniques and advanced modeling, i.e. the collaboration of scientists in various specialties. This volume gives insights into new techniques allowing for the first time to obtain resolved images of stars. It takes stock of what has been achieved so far in Chile, on the ESO VLTI instrument or, in the States, on the CHARA instrument. In recent times interferometry, combined with adaptive optics has allowed to reconstruct images of stars. Besides the Sun (of course) by now five stars have been resolved in detail. In addition to interferometry, this book highlights techniques used for mapping the surfaces of stars using photometry made by space observatories; Zeeman- and Doppler Imaging; mapping the surface element abundances via spectroscopy. This book will also take stock of the best images of the solar surface, made by connecting the differential rotation to the underlying physical parameters derived from helioseismology. Recent measurements of flattening of the solar surface by SDO showed that the Sun’s shape is linked to the rotation of the core. It is shown how such a result is generalizable to the stars.

Studying the fine properties of solutions to Stochastic (Partial) Differential Equations with reflection at a boundary, this book begins with a discussion of classical one-dimensional diffusions as the reflecting Brownian motion, devoting a chapter to Bessel processes, and moves on to function-valued solutions to SPDEs. Inspired by the classical stochastic calculus for diffusions, which is unfortunately still unavailable in infinite dimensions, it uses integration by parts formulae on convex sets of paths in order to describe the behaviour of the solutions at the boundary and the contact set between the solution and the obstacle. The text may serve as an introduction to space-time white noise, SPDEs and monotone gradient systems.

The present volume aims to be a comprehensive survey on the derivation of the equations of motion, both in General Relativity as well as in alternative gravity theories. The topics covered range from the description of test bodies, to self-gravitating (heavy) bodies, to current and future observations. Emphasis is put on the coverage of various approximation methods (e.g., multipolar, post-Newtonian, self-force methods) which are extensively used in the context of the relativistic problem of motion. Applications discussed in this volume range from the motion of binary systems -- and the gravitational waves emitted by such systems -- to observations of the galactic center. In particular the impact of choices at a fundamental theoretical level on the interpretation of experiments is highlighted.

In early April 1911 Albert Einstein arrived in Prague to become full professor of theoretical physics at the German part of Charles University.

Before he left Prague in July 1912 he had submitted the paper “Relativität und Gravitation: Erwiderung auf eine Bemerkung von M. Abraham” in which he remarkably anticipated what a future theory of gravity should look like. At the occasion of the Einstein-in-Prague centenary an international meeting was organized under a title inspired by Einstein's last paper from the Prague period: \"Relativity and Gravitation, 100 Years after Einstein in Prague\". The main topics of the conference included: classical relativity, numerical relativity, relativistic astrophysics and cosmology, quantum gravity, experimental aspects of gravitation, and conceptual and historical issues. The conference attracted over 200 scientists from 31 countries, among them a number of leading experts in the field of general relativity and its applications.

This volume on Ultrafast Magnetism is a collection of articles presented at the international “Ultrafast Magnetization Conference” held at the Congress Center in Strasbourg, France, from October 28th to November 1st, 2013. This first conference, which is intended to be held every two years, received a wonderful attendance and gathered scientists from 27 countries in the field of Femtomagnetism, encompassing many theoretical and experimental research subjects related to the spins dynamics in bulk or nanostructured materials. The participants appreciated this unique opportunity for discussing new ideas and debating on various physical interpretations of the reported phenomena. The format of a single session with many oral contributions as well as extensive time for poster presentations allowed researchers to have a detailed overview of the field. Importantly, one could sense that, in addition to studying fundamental magnetic phenomena, ultrafast magnetism has entered in a phase where applied physics and engineering are playing an important role. Several devices are being proposed with exciting R&D perspectives in the near future, in particular for magnetic recording, time resolved magnetic imaging and spin polarized transport, therefore establishing connections between various aspects of modern magnetism. Simultaneously, the diversity of techniques and experimental configurations has flourished during the past years, employing in particular Xrays, visible, infra-red and terahertz radiations. It was also obvious that an important effort is being made for tracking the dynamics of spins and magnetic domains at the nanometer scale, opening the pathway to exciting future developments. The concerted efforts between theoretical and experimental approaches for explaining the dynamical behaviors of angular momentum and energy levels, on different classes of magnetic materials, are worth pointing out. Finally it was unanimously recognized that the quality of the scientific oral and poster presentations contributed to bring the conference to a very high international standard", "title_en": "Ultrafast Magnetism I : Proceedings of the International Conference UMC 2013 Strasbourg, France, October 28th - November 1st, 2013"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4186732-4", "gnd:4045956-1", "gnd:4327470-5", "gnd:4037021-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1057974919", "year": "2015", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The humanities and cultural studies are repeatedly invited to participate in research on global climate change. However, this interdisciplinary task rests on epistemological preconditions that need to be made transparent. Against this background, this edited volume asks what might constitute a genuine contribution to research on global climate change by the humanities and cultural studies. The volume approaches this question by dealing with early modern research literature that examines extreme weather events during the Little Ice Age. In the same way as humans do today, humans back then experienced climate change through extreme weather events, and they tried to provide intellectual access to these experiences. This edited volume deals with German and English-speaking authors who lived between 1600 and 1850 (A. Coppe, S. Dach, J. Rist, P. Gerhard, D. Defoe, B.H. Brockes, F. Hölderlin and J. Gotthelf). They dealt with climate-induced extremes in different ways and, in doing so, made information about them available to society.With contributions by:Dr. Gero Bauer, Dr. Stefan Hofer, Prof. Dr. Ingrid Hotz-Davies, Junior-Doz.

Die Geistes- und Kulturwissenschaften werden wiederholt eingeladen, sich an der Beforschung des globalen Klimawandels zu beteiligen. Diese interdisziplinäre Aufgabe beruht jedoch auf Voraussetzungen, die transparent zu machen sind.

Er nähert sich dieser Frage über die Beschäftigung mit frühneuzeitlicher Literatur, die sich im Kontext der Kleinen Eiszeit mit Extremwetter-Ereignissen auseinandersetzt. Heute wie damals erfuhren Menschen Klimawandel auch über extreme Wetterlagen, und sie versuchten, diese Erfahrung intellektuell zugänglich zu machen. Der Sammelband beschäftigt sich mit deutsch- und englischsprachigen Autoren aus dem Zeitraum von 1600 bis 1850, die in ganz unterschiedlicher Weise mit klimabedingten Extremen umgehen und diese derart gesellschaftlich verfügbar machen.Mit Beiträgen von:Dr. Gero Bauer, Dr. Stefan Hofer, Prof. Dr. Ingrid Hotz-Davies, Junior-Doz.

Excellence in education without equity risks leading to large economic and social disparities; equity in education at the expense of quality is a meaningless aspiration. The most advanced education systems now set ambitious goals for all students, focusing on both excellence and equity. They also equip their teachers with the pedagogic skills that have been proven effective and with enough autonomy so that teachers can use their own creativity in determining the content and instruction they provide to their individual students. The fourth International Summit on the Teaching Profession brought together education ministers, union leaders and other teacher leaders from high-performing and rapidly improving education systems, as measured by PISA (the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment ). Their aim was to discuss equity, excellence and inclusiveness in education by exploring three questions: • How are high-quality teachers developed, and how do schools with the greatest need attract and retain them? • How can equity be ensured in increasingly devolved education systems? and • What kinds of learning environments address the needs of all students? To underpin the discussions, this publication identifies some of the steps policy makers can take to build school systems that are both equitable and excellent.

As an application, we solve the second boundary value problem of the prescribed affine mean curvature equation, which can be viewed as a coupling of the latter two equations. Of interest in its own right, the linearized Monge-Ampère equation also has deep connections and applications in analysis, fluid mechanics and geometry, including the semi-geostrophic equations in atmospheric flows, the affine maximal surface equation in affine geometry and the problem of finding Kahler metrics of constant scalar curvature in complex geometry.

As in the previous Seminar Notes, the current volume reflects general trends in the study of Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis. Most of the papers deal with different aspects of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, understood in a broad sense; many continue the study of geometric and volumetric properties of convex bodies and log-concave measures in high-dimensions and in particular the mean-norm, mean-width, metric entropy, spectral-gap, thin-shell and slicing parameters, with applications to Dvoretzky and Central-Limit-type results. The study of spectral properties of various systems, matrices, operators and potentials is another central theme in this volume. As expected, probabilistic tools play a significant role and probabilistic questions regarding Gaussian noise stability, the Gaussian Free Field and First Passage Percolation are also addressed. The historical connection to the field of Classical Convexity is also well represented with new properties and applications of mixed-volumes.

The 16th and 17th centuries, characterised as they were by political, social and religious upheaval, represent a key period for historical security studies. This era was shaped by discourses of threat as well as attempts to find answers to the multiple challenges to public order and security. Such insecurity was doubtlessly accentuated by religious and confessional conflicts, as this comparative study of France and the Holy Roman Empire shows. In fact, the range of contributions in this edited volume on ‘security problems’ demonstrates how much the frames within which the issue of security was raised became more and more diverse over the course of the two centuries. In a time of evident conflict, the notion of ‘security’ was deemed increasingly important, which ultimately made it a leading concept in early modern political culture. Der von sozialen, politischen und religiösen Umbrüchen geprägte Zeitraum des 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts stellt eine Schlüsselperiode für eine historische Sicherheitsforschung dar. Er ist geprägt von Diskursen der Bedrohung und Versuchen, Antworten auf die akuten Herausforderungen öffentlicher Ordnung und Sicherheit zu finden. Zweifellos akzentuierten die Konflikte um Religion und Konfession die Unsicherheiten in besonderer Weise, wofür der vergleichende Blick auf Frankreich und das Heilige Römische Reich deutscher Nation zahlreiche Belege erbringt. Auf diese Konfliktlagen beschränkt sich das Thema Sicherheit für die Zeitgenossen jedoch nicht. Die Spannbreite der im vorliegenden Sammelband behandelten „Sicherheitsprobleme“ dokumentiert vielmehr, wie sehr sich in diesen beiden Jahrhunderten Bezüge, in denen Sicherheit thematisiert wurde, ausdifferenziert haben. In einem Zeitraum manifester Friedlosigkeit wuchs der Kategorie „Sicherheit“ eine immer größere Bedeutung zu, die sie schließlich zu einem Leitbegriff der politischen Kultur in der Frühen Neuzeit machte.", "title_en": "Sicherheitsprobleme im 16. und 17.

Emerging technologies have always played an important role in armed conflict. From the crossbow to cyber capabilities, technology that could be weaponized to create an advantage over an adversary has inevitably found its way into military arsenals for use in armed conflict. The weaponization of emerging technologies, however, raises challenging legal issues with respect to the law of armed conflict. As States continue to develop and exploit new technologies, how will the law of armed conflict address the use of these technologies on the battlefield? Is existing law sufficient to regulate new technologies, such as cyber capabilities, autonomous weapons systems, and artificial intelligence? Have emerging technologies fundamentally altered the way we should understand concepts such as law-of-war precautions and the principle of distinction?

Furthermore, the development of AM technologies has practical implications for economic growth, healthcare, national security, space exploration, and sustainability. For military and space agencies, AM offers the possibility to transform the traditional supply chain system through manufacturing at-point-of-demand, recycling, and indigenous sourcing of raw materials. Similarly, these concepts are being leveraged by remote communities across the globe through efforts such as Fab Labs, which provide low-cost access to manufacturing technologies. AM is transforming healthcare in unexpected ways: doctors and patients have access to high-quality physical 3D models generated directly from computerized tomography (CT) scans. These surgical guides have proved invaluable in surgical preparation and patient consent. In the lab, researchers are developing medical devices or implants which mimic the patient's physiology, are pre-loaded with therapeutics, and are replaced with the patient's cells through natural tissue repair pathways. Pushing the limits of resolution, multi-photon technologies, which allow subdiffraction-limited resolution, are revolutionizing the development of micro-optical components. Unfortunately, adoption of AM technologies by industry has been slow; and while there are numerous success stories and commercial adoption is steadily increasing, AM is hampered by weak parts, incomplete certification methods, and empirical materials development. Regulatory and standards bodies are working to update or develop new standards and policies to deal with the unique material and production issues posed by AM. Many of the challenges facing the industry stem from our limited understanding of structure-process-performance relationships. These challenges fall into many categories and require a broad range of skills to address. For the researcher, AM processes offer unique challenges in materials development, metrology, and modeling, as well as opportunities to combine all three. What makes a polymer printable? What process parameters are important? How should parts be tested? These are all active areas of investigation. This book was inspired by the 2017 ACS Symposium \"Additive Manufacturing of Structures and Functional Devices: Materials, Methods, Models, and Testing\" and is supplemented by additional experts in the polymer AM field. The chapters discuss the technologies, measurement challenges, manufacturing opportunities, and fabrication potentials. We begin with an introduction to polymer additive manufacturing, identifying the measurement needs and technical challenges facing the industry. A chapter reviewing polymer powder bed fusion follows, providing a complete discussion on methods, materials, and applications. The bulk of the book covers thermoplastic material extrusion, with chapters discussing recycling-based feedstocks, composites materials, and multi-physics modeling linking experimentation and theory. Moving from thermoplastics to conductive inks, a chapter on in situ monitoring and control of direct-ink-write provides a clear example of how theory and modern machine vision can be used to create a practical and responsive control system. The last chapter provides a state-of-the-art review of multi-photon printing, discussing methods, materials, and the stunning capabilities of the technique\"--", "title_en": "Polymer-based additive manufacturing : recent developments"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4046699-1", "gnd:4170297-9", "gnd:1032223197"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:130393-4; gnd:1277646902", "year": "2019", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Throughout the developing world, children are suffering from the severe consequences micronutrient deficiencies have on their healthy development. However, early malnutrition is not a problem confined to that part of the world. It may also affect infants born prematurely, children living in poverty and new immigrants to developed countries. Written by leading investigators and clinicians, this publication begins with a review of the epidemiology of micronutrient deficiencies. Further chapters deal with stable isotope methods in research, new etiological aspects such as the impact of micronutrient interactions, bioavailability and infectious diseases, as well as the effects of socio- and geopolitical factors. Another section focuses on the implications of micronutrient deficiencies and psycho-motor development, immune function and bone growth, with regard also to the economic impact.

In this collection of original essays, twenty-six leading scholars reconsider the long history of proportional systems across numerous periods and places, and from diverse methodological approaches including archival exploration, advanced laser scanning, and more. Prior to the advent of modern structural engineering, architects and builders used proportional systems to imbue their works with a general condition of order that was integral to their intertwined notions of beauty and structural stability. These mostly invisible intellectual frameworks ranged from simple grids and symbolic numbers, to sly manipulations of geometry and numbers that required privileged knowledge and arithmetical calculations to access. Since the origins of architectural history, proportional systems have served as objects of belief and modes of iconographical communication. Whether they are capable of fulfilling more tangible functions remains a matter of debate today, for this ancient and diverse belief system continues to infiltrate architectural thinking in subtle and sometimes surprising ways", "title_en": "Proportional systems in the history of architecture : a critical reconsideration"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4002851-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1223629465", "year": "2018", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1677324546", "content": {"text": "Räumliche Transformation : Prozesse, Konzepte, Forschungsdesigns. What can be understood by spatial transformation, how does it \"show\" itself and what are the characteristics of transformation processes? The research report addresses these questions and presents current research projects and approaches from a scientific and (planning-)practical perspective. A central point of reference is the term \"Great Transformation\", which derives from a report by the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU). It outlines the profound changes in the economy and society towards sustainability that will become necessary in the future and describes them as a \"Great Transformation\". Accordingly, social upheavals also manifest themselves in space, thus enabling spatial changes to be understood as spatial transformations. However, it remains unclear what is to be understood in detail by processes of spatial transformation and in which manifestations they occur. Against the background of this need for (further) research, the research report is addressing concrete issues in the research and design of spatial transformation processes. The aim is to systematize the largely disordered knowledge of processes of spatial transformation and to contribute to a common understanding of terms, which can form the basis for further research and control of these processes. The contributions on the following topic lines show how spatial and social transformation processes are mutually dependent and what opportunities and challenges interand transdisciplinary research designs offer in this context: Perspectives on transformation processes, Changing social and settlement structures, Regional development and innovation, Transformation processes in the so-called Global South, New challenges for planning, processes and stakeholders, Research on transformation. The contributions to theoretical, methodological and practical approaches are intended to stimulate a critical discussion on the topic of spatial transformation that is open to new, interdisciplinary perspectives. Was kann unter räumlicher Transformation verstanden werden, wie \"zeigt\" sie sich und wodurch zeichnen sich Transformationsprozesse eigentlich aus? Dieser Forschungsbericht setzt an diesen Fragen an und stellt aktuelle Forschungsprojekte und Herangehensweisen aus wissenschaftlicher und (planungs-)praktischer Perspektive dar. Ein zentraler Bezugspunkt ist dabei der Begriff der \"Großen Transformation\", der einem Gutachten des Wissenschaftlichen Beirats der Bundesregierung Globale Umweltveränderungen (WBGU) entlehnt ist. Das Gutachten stellt die künftig notwendig werdenden tiefgreifenden Veränderungen von Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft in Richtung Nachhaltigkeit heraus und beschreibt sie als \"Große Transformation\". Hiernach manifestieren sich gesellschaftliche Umbrüche auch im Raum, sodass raumrelevante Veränderungen als räumliche Transformationen gefasst werden können. Unklar bleibt jedoch, was im Detail unter Prozessen räumlicher Transformation zu verstehen ist und in welchen Erscheinungsformen sie auftreten. Vor dem Hintergrund dieses Forschungsbedarfes widmet sich der Forschungsbericht konkreten Fragestellungen der Erforschung und Gestaltung räumlicher Transformationsprozesse. Ziel ist es, das weitgehend ungeordnete Wissen zu Prozessen der räumlichen Transformation zu systematisieren und einen Beitrag zu einem gemeinsamen Begriffsverständnis zu leisten, das eine Grundlage für die weitergehende Erforschung und Steuerung dieser Prozesse sein kann. Wie räumliche und gesellschaftliche Transformationsprozesse sich wechselseitig bedingen und welche Chancen und Herausforderungen inter- und transdisziplinäre Forschungsdesigns in diesem Zusammenhang bieten, zeigen die Beiträge zu folgenden Themenlinien auf: Perspektiven auf Transformationsprozesse, Sozial- und Siedlungsstrukturen im Wandel, Regionalentwicklung und Innovation, Transformationsprozesse im sogenannten Globalen Süden, Neue Herausforderungen für Planung, Prozesse und Akteure, Forschen zur Transformation. Die Beiträge zu theoretischen, methodischen und praktischen Ansätzen sollen eine kritische Diskussion zum Thema \"Räumliche Transformation\" anregen, die offen für neue, fachübergreifende Perspektiven ist.", "title_en": "Räumliche Transformation : Prozesse, Konzepte, Forschungsdesigns"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4048561-4", "gnd:4451062-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:37457-X; gnd:1195167679; gnd:1195168403", "year": "2019", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "de"}}

Did the advent of printing bring about changes in the corpus of narrative texts when compared with the corpus extant in manuscript copies? Did narrative texts that already existed in manuscript form undergo significant modifications when they began to be printed? How did this crucial media development affect the nature of these narratives? Which strategies did early printers develop to make their texts commercially attractive? Which social classes were the target audiences for their editions?

The Haifa 2000 Workshop on \"Inherently Parallel Algorithms for Feasibility and Optimization and their Applications\" brought together top scientists in this area. The objective of the Workshop was to discuss, analyze and compare the latest developments in this fast growing field of applied mathematics and to identify topics of research which are of special interest for industrial applications and for further theoretical study. Inherently parallel algorithms, that is, computational methods which are, by their mathematical nature, parallel, have been studied in various contexts for more than fifty years. However, it was only during the last decade that they have mostly proved their practical usefulness because new generations of computers made their implementation possible in order to solve complex feasibility and optimization problems involving huge amounts of data via parallel processing. These led to an accumulation of computational experience and theoretical information and opened new and challenging questions concerning the behavior of inherently parallel algorithms for feasibility and optimization, their convergence in new environments and in circumstances in which they were not considered before their stability and reliability. Several research groups all over the world focused on these questions and it was the general feeling among scientists involved in this effort that the time has come to survey the latest progress and convey a perspective for further development and concerted scientific investigations. Thus, the editors of this volume, with the support of the Israeli Academy for Sciences and Humanities, took the initiative of organizing a Workshop intended to bring together the leading scientists in the field. The current volume is the Proceedings of the Workshop representing the discussions, debates and communications that took place. Having all that information collected in a single book will provide mathematicians and engineers interested in the theoretical and practical aspects of the inherently parallel algorithms for feasibility and optimization with a tool for determining when, where and which algorithms in this class are fit for solving specific problems, how reliable they are, how they behave and how efficient they were in previous applications. Such a tool will allow software creators to choose ways of better implementing these methods by learning from existing experience", "title_en": "Inherently parallel algorithms in feasibility and optimization and their applications"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4193615-2", "gnd:4043664-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Research Workshop on Inherently Parallel Algorithms in Feasibility and Optimization and Their Applications", "year": "2001", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This volume contains lectures and invited papers from the Focus Program on \"Nonlinear Dispersive Partial Differential Equations and Inverse Scattering\" held at the Fields Institute from July 31-August 18, 2017. The conference brought together researchers in completely integrable systems and PDE with the goal of advancing the understanding of qualitative and long-time behavior in dispersive nonlinear equations. The program included Percy Deift’s Coxeter lectures, which appear in this volume together with tutorial lectures given during the first week of the focus program. The research papers collected here include new results on the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation, the massive Thirring model, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahoney equation as dispersive PDE in one space dimension, as well as the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II equation, the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation as dispersive PDE in two space dimensions. The Focus Program coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery by Gardner, Greene, Kruskal and Miura that the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation could be integrated by exploiting a remarkable connection between KdV and the spectral theory of Schrodinger's equation in one space dimension. This led to the discovery of a number of completely integrable models of dispersive wave propagation, including the cubic NLS equation, and the derivative NLS equation in one space dimension and the Davey-Stewartson, Kadomtsev-Petviashvili and Novikov-Veselov equations in two space dimensions. These models have been extensively studied and, in some cases, the inverse scattering theory has been put on rigorous footing.

The Industrial Revolution is often seen as a turning point in the emergence of the urban landscape of the modern metropolis, and the large city as commonly experienced today in the world is certainly dependent on a range of recent (or quite recent) breakthroughs in construction technology, climate control, communication, and transportation. In this view, urban landscapes are a historically late development and are, therefore, seen to embody an essentially modern and Western concept. But features associated with contemporary urban landscapes-most notably the forms of human adaptation to and reshaping of the sites where cities develop and expand-can also be found in preindustrial contexts in different time periods and geographical regions. Preindustrial urban settlements generally occupied land that had been used for other, mostly productive, purposes, and their development involved complex and dynamic relationships with the management of natural resources.

Leading scientists in the fields of climate dynamics, atmosphere and ocean dynamics, geophysical fluid dynamics, physics and non-linear sciences present their views on this fast growing and interdisciplinary field of research, by venturing upon fundamental problems of atmospheric convection, clouds, large scale circulation, and predictability. Climate is controlled by turbulent flows. Turbulent motions are responsible for the bulk of the transport of energy, momentum, and water vapor in the atmosphere, which determine the distribution of temperature, winds, and precipitation on Earth. Clouds, weather systems, and boundary layers in the oceans and atmosphere are manifestations of turbulence in the climate system. Because turbulence remains as the great unsolved problem of classical physics, we do not have a complete physical theory of climate. The aim of this summer school was to survey what is known about how turbulent flows control climate, what role they may play in climate change, and to outline where progress in this important area can be expected, given today's computational and observational capabilities.

The annual workshop on multiword expressions takes place since 2001 in conjunction with major computational linguistics conferences and attracts the attention of an ever-growing community working on a variety of languages, linguistic phenomena and related computational processing issues. MWE 2017 took place in Valencia, Spain, and represented a vibrant panorama of the current research landscape on the computational treatment of multiword expressions, featuring many high-quality submissions. Furthermore, MWE 2017 included the first shared task on multilingual identification of verbal multiword expressions. The shared task, with extended communal work, has developed important multilingual resources and mobilised several research groups in computational linguistics worldwide. This book contains extended versions of selected papers from the workshop. Authors worked hard to include detailed explanations, broader and deeper analyses, and new exciting results, which were thoroughly reviewed by an internationally renowned committee. We hope that this distinctly joint effort will provide a meaningful and useful snapshot of the multilingual state of the art in multiword expressions modelling and processing, and will be a point point of reference for future work", "title_en": "Multiword expressions at length and in depth : extended papers from the MWE 2017 workshop"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4035843-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1176036734", "year": "2018", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This book collects together a unique set of articles dedicated to several fundamental aspects of the Navier–Stokes equations. As is well known, understanding the mathematical properties of these equations, along with their physical interpretation, constitutes one of the most challenging questions of applied mathematics. Indeed, the Navier–Stokes equations feature among the Clay Mathematics Institute's seven Millennium Prize Problems (existence of global in time, regular solutions corresponding to initial data of unrestricted magnitude). The text comprises three extensive contributions covering the following topics: (1) Operator-Valued H∞-calculus, R-boundedness, Fourier multipliers and maximal Lp-regularity theory for a large, abstract class of quasi-linear evolution problems with applications to Navier–Stokes equations and other fluid model equations; (2) Classical existence, uniqueness and regularity theorems of solutions to the Navier–Stokes initial-value problem, along with space-time partial regularity and investigation of the smoothness of the Lagrangean flow map; and (3) A complete mathematical theory of R-boundedness and maximal regularity with applications to free boundary problems for the Navier–Stokes equations with and without surface tension. Offering a general mathematical framework that could be used to study fluid problems and, more generally, a wide class of abstract evolution equations, this volume is aimed at graduate students and researchers who want to become acquainted with fundamental problems related to the Navier–Stokes equations.

This was the first high energy physics experiment in China, and has been unique, throughout the world, for its thorough and extended coverage of the tau and charm energy region. Over these 30 years, the BES detector has been steadily improved, upgrading to BESII in 1998 and to BESIII in 2008. And over the same period, the collaboration has evolved from including about 150 members from 10 institutions in China and the United States to about 500 members from 72 institutions in 15 countries. The physics program, too, has extended from light hadron spectroscopy, tau, and charm physics to the discovery of exotic charmoniumlike states, precision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics, and searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This special volume collects the proceedings of the symposium held at the Institute of High Energy Physics, Beijing in celebration of the 30-year great achievements of the BES, BESII, and BESIII experiments.

New Investigations in Collective Form presents a group of design experiments by the design-research office The Open Workshop, that test how architecture can empower the diverse voices that make up the public realm and the environments in which they exist. Today, society continues to face urban challenges-from economic inequality to a progressively fragile natural environment-that, in order to be addressed, require us to come together in a moment when what we collectively value is increasingly difficult to locate. Organized into five themes for producing collectivity-Frameworks, Articulated Surfaces, the Living Archive, Re-Wiring States, and Commoning-the projects straddle the fine line between the individual and collective, informal and formal, choice and control, impermanent and permanent In 1964, Fumihiko Maki published his seminal text, Investigations in Collective Form, which he framed as the beginning of a vast inquiry on collective form. In the text, a young Maki grapples with the role of urban design and the urban designer, who is \"charged with giving form\" to the city. The emerging challenges Maki witnessed for the urban designer resided in the series of recent changes to the urban realm, including the \"coexistence and conflict of amazingly heterogeneous institutions and individuals; unprecedented rapid and extensive transformations in physical structure of society; rapid communications methods; and technological progress and its impacts upon regional cultures\". What Maki so eloquently pointed out was the need for the designer to now think simultaneously about dynamic cycles, time, and transformations, which he termed \"the master program\" and as well as how form (or in Maki's terms, the \"master form\") responded to these temporal scenarios. This shift demanded by Maki in the role of the architect was indeed a profound one, as the architect's role throughout history had been to determine lines that ordered the world. We could say that the majority of architecture and urban design of the twentieth century aimed to tame the contradictory, heterogeneous, and contingent urban environment, both physically as well as socio-politically. In the past two centuries, as cities have rapidly expanded into vast urban territories that are organized through the negotiation of politics, economics, and cultural values, the ability to determine such lines of order has become progressively more complex and suspect. Instead of controlling and assimilating the individual and the natural environments they inhabit, the design-research of The Open Workshop is focused on understanding how design can embrace the diversity and indeterminacy of the urban realm", "title_en": "New investigations in collective form : The Open Workshop"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4139212-7", "gnd:4056723-0", "gnd:4172385-5", "gnd:4077804-6", "gnd:4312811-7", "gnd:4043207-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1014487080; gnd:5300093-6", "year": "2019", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Continuing the theme of the previous volume, these seminar notes reflect general trends in the study of Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, understood in a broad sense. Two classical topics represented are the Concentration of Measure Phenomenon in the Local Theory of Banach Spaces, which has recently had triumphs in Random Matrix Theory, and the Central Limit Theorem, one of the earliest examples of regularity and order in high dimensions. Central to the text is the study of the Poincaré and log-Sobolev functional inequalities, their reverses, and other inequalities, in which a crucial role is often played by convexity assumptions such as Log-Concavity. The concept and properties of Entropy form an important subject, with Bourgain's slicing problem and its variants drawing much attention. Constructions related to Convexity Theory are proposed and revisited, as well as inequalities that go beyond the Brunn–Minkowski theory. One of the major current research directions addressed is the identification of lower-dimensional structures with remarkable properties in rather arbitrary high-dimensional objects.

Based on an overview of the scientific background and technological options for emissions reduction, Climate Change and the Aviation Industry provides an in-depth assessment of environmental regulation and management. It provides an up-to-the-minute analysis of the effects of aviation on climate change, and an economic analysis of policies to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. The main emphasis of the book is on the economic mechanisms used to lessen emissions - carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes and offset schemes. It pays particular attention to the ways these policies work, and to the interaction between them - for instance, the interaction between taxes and emissions trading schemes. One feature of the book is that it analyses the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) which has been developed by ICAO for international aviation, and which is due to commence operation shortly. The advantages and disadvantages of this controversial scheme are discussed. This book will be of interest to researchers in diverse areas (economics, political science, engineering, natural sciences), to air transport policy makers, and to managers in the aviation industry\"--", "title_en": "Aviation and climate change : economic perspectives on greenhouse gas reduction policies"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4036557-8", "gnd:4177306-8", "gnd:4438735-0", "gnd:4164199-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2020", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Both material types derive their advantageous properties from a cellular structure. These properties include: low weight, high specific stiffness and strength, excellent energy absorption capacity, as well as damping and insulation properties. On the other hand, the processing of metals is far more difficult due to the higher temperatures involved. Another important factor is the faster decay of metal foam structures, at the end of the foaming process, because of their combination of high surface tension and low viscosity. The differences in foamability, between metals and polymers, explain why cellular plastics have been widely used for some time whereas cellular metals have only recently found their first applications. The present volume expertly reviews the known scientific results in these fields; particularly with regard to the understanding of foam processing (e.g. mechanisms of stabilization) as well as foam properties (e.g. the material's response to fatigue and crash situations).This collection constitutes an essential sourcebook for researchers, producers and users seeking technical information on materials with foam-like structures. The 63 papers of this proceedings were first presented at the Symposium on Cellular Metals and Polymers, sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, in October 2004, in Fürth, Germany. Also included are reports from the DFG program on Cellular Metals. Keynote talks were given on topics that include an overview of the mechanical properties of foams and periodic lattice materials, physics of polymer foams, and the role of rheology in foaming polymers. The papers are grouped into sections, including processes of metal foams, properties of metal foams, particle foams and simulation, component fabrication and application of metal foams, and commercial applications and products of polymer foams.

This book presents a panorama of recent developments in the theory of tilings and related dynamical systems. It contains an expanded version of courses given in 2017 at the research school associated with the Jean-Morlet chair program. Tilings have been designed, used and studied for centuries in various contexts. This field grew significantly after the discovery of aperiodic self-similar tilings in the 60s, linked to the proof of the undecidability of the Domino problem, and was driven futher by Dan Shechtman's discovery of quasicrystals in 1984. Tiling problems establish a bridge between the mutually influential fields of geometry, dynamical systems, aperiodic order, computer science, number theory, algebra and logic. The main properties of tiling dynamical systems are covered, with expositions on recent results in self-similarity (and its generalizations, fusions rules and S-adic systems), algebraic developments connected to physics, games and undecidability questions, and the spectrum of substitution tilings.

We all wait - in traffic jams, passport offices, school meal queues, for better weather, an end to fighting, peace. Time spent waiting produces hope, boredom, anxiety, doubt, or uncertainty.

Using waiting as a central analytical category, the book investigates how waiting is negotiated in myriad ways. Examining the politics and poetics of waiting, Ethnographies of Waiting offers fresh perspectives on waiting as the uncertain interplay between doubting and hoping, and asks \"When is time worth the wait?\" Waiting thus conceived is intrinsic to the ethnographic method at the heart of the anthropological enterprise.

This proceedings book provides the latest developments on water as a unique resource that can meet the fundamental needs of human beings and ecosystems. Wastewater generated in industrial, commercial, residential and sensible places must take care as it may pollute the ground and surface water if not treated properly. Environmental pollution discharged from industrial, commercial, residential and sensible places must take care as it may pollute the air, water and land if not treated properly. Most of the design and development of wastewater technologies and environmental treatment were unable to take load as there is huge amount of wastewater and environmental pollution that was generating every day. This threatens the sustainable development, and it needs to solve in accurate, reliable, urgent and timely. Our interest is sustainable innovative and technological transfer approaches which can be used available for supporting, operationalizing and delivering sustainable wastewater technologies and environmental treatment.

Long before museum architecture became a popular tourist attraction, architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage and museum director Hendrik Enno van Gelder dreamed of an iconic museum building, a building in which visitors would feel at home and art would flourish in an ultimate setting. In 1935, their dream came true with the opening of a new museum for modern and applied art in The Hague. Although Berlage died in 1934 and thus did not live to see the museum completed, he and Van Gelder set an example for many later creations.00This richly illustrated book takes the original ideas of both the architect and the director as its starting point and shows how their ideas continue to contribute to the experience of Kunstmuseum Den Haag to this day. More than 150 photographs and a wealth of historical material provide a comprehensive picture of the building, including spaces that normally remain closed to visitors.

The Risk of Deepening Agrarian Extractivism when Promoting Bioeconomy in Argentina; Anne Tittor. This open access book explores bioeconomy and bioenergy policies across South America, Asia and Europe. It discusses how a transition away from a fossil and towards a bio-based economic order alters, reinforces and challenges socio-ecological inequalities. A series of conceptual discussions and case studies with a multidisciplinary background in the social sciences illuminate how the deployment of biomass sources from the agricultural and forestry sectors affect societal changes concerning knowledge production, land and labour relations, political participation and international trade. How can a global perspective on socio-ecological inequalities contribute to a critical understanding of bioeconomy? Who participates in the negotiation of specific bioeconomy policies and who does not? To what extent does the bioeconomy affect existing socio-ecological inequalities in rural areas? What are the implications of the bioeconomy for existing relations of extraction and inequalities across regions? The volume is an invitation to reflect upon these questions and more, at a time when the need for an ecological and socially just transition away from a carbon intensive economy is becoming increasingly pressing. The editors, Maria Backhouse, Rosa Lehmann, Kristina Lorenzen, Malte Lühmann, Janina Puder, Fabricio Rodríguez and Anne Tittor are all social scientists and members of the Junior Research Group “Bioeconomy and Inequalities.

This book, based on a selection of invited presentations from a topical workshop, focusses on time-variable oscillations and their interactions. The problem is challenging, because the origin of the time variability is usually unknown. In mathematical terms, the oscillations are non-autonomous, reflecting the physics of open systems where the function of each oscillator is affected by its environment. Time-frequency analysis being essential, recent advances in this area, including wavelet phase coherence analysis and nonlinear mode decomposition, are discussed. Some applications to biology and physiology are described. Although the most important manifestation of time-variable oscillations is arguably in biology, they also crop up in, e.g. astrophysics, or for electrons on superfluid helium.

This volume contains proceedings of the NATO-Russia Advanced Research Workshop on Nanostructured Thin Films and Nanodispersion Strengthened Coatings (December, 2003, Moscow). During this Workshop leading researchers from twelve countries had presented and discussed most recent developments in the fields of plasma physics and surface engineering related to the preparation and applications of nanostructured thin films and nanodispersion strengthened coatings. These presentations are encompassed in 31 individual chapters. The chapters are assembled in five parts in according to the workshop sessions. Part I is a compilation of chapters on hard and tribological coatings. The recent advances in this area are significant in that it is now possible to engineer strong, hard, and tough coatings that can operate at temperatures higher than 1200 ?C and exhibit ‘smart’, adaptive characteristics. These coatings are based on an amorphous matrix, e. g. nitrides, carbides, borides, or carbon, in which there is a controlled nucleation and growth of ultra hard nanoparticles of crystalline carbides, nitrides, borides and oxides. The critical feature is the control of both the particle size, i. e. , less than 10 nm, and interpartical spacing of a few nanometers. The ‘smart’ or adaptive characteristic is engineered into the nanostructures using similar sized (less than 10 nm) particles of metallic chalcogenidese, ductile metals, or glass forming elements to provide high lubricity and chemical adaptation at the environment change, e. g. , high and low humidities and temperatures.", "title_en": "Nanostructured Thin Films and Nanodispersion Strengthened Coatings"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4136925-7", "gnd:4342626-8", "gnd:4144863-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2004", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The field of composite materials has seen substantial development in the past decade, New composite systems are being continually developed for various applications. Among such systems are metal, intermetallic, and superalloy matrix composites, carbon-carbon composites as well as polymer matrix composites. At the same time, a new discipline has emerged of active or smart materials, which are often constructed as composite or heterogeneous media and structures. One unifying theme in these diverse systems is the influence that uncoupled and coupled eigenfields or transformation fields exert on the various types of overall response, as well as on the respective phase responses. Problems of this kind are currently considered by different groups which may not always appreciate the similarities of the problems involved. The purpose of the IUTAM Symposium on Transformation Problems in Composite and Active Materials held in Cairo, Egypt from March 10 to 12, 1997 was to bring together representatives of the different groups so that they may interact and explore common aspects of these seemingly different problem areas. New directions in micromechanics research in both composite and active materials were also explored in the symposium. Specifically, invited lectures in the areas of inelastic behavior of composite materials, shape memory effects, functionally graded materials, transformation problems in composite structures, and adaptive structures were delivered and discussed during the three-day meeting. This book contains the printed contributions to the IUTAM Symposium.", "title_en": "IUTAM Symposium on Transformation Problems in Composite and Active Materials : Proceedings of the IUTAM Symposium held in Cairo, Egypt, 9–12 March 1997"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4217961-0", "gnd:4062670-2", "gnd:4274825-2", "gnd:4495404-9", "gnd:4014159-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2002", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The Hans Kleinpoppen Symposium on \"Complete Scattering Experiments\" th was held in honor of Hans Kleinpoppen’s 70 birthday. It took place in Il Ciocco, Italy. The symposium had two purposes: to present the work that Hans Kleinpoppen has done or initiated during his remarkable scientific career, and to bring people from various fields together who perform complete scattering experiments. Hans Kleinpoppen’s work included electron and photon impact experiments which were accompanied by studies of entangled states - a field of high current interest. Representatives from each of these fields gave excellent lectures on their particular subjects, and many discussions that started during the sessions were continued later in the relaxed atmosphere of the Il Ciocco resort. The breathtaking view of the beautiful landscape will be an unforg- table memory to all who participated in this extraordinary scientific event. The coherent and ideal combination of subject, people and location reflected the coherence of Hans Kleinpoppen’s aims and activities in science and life.

Several contributing papers focused on case studies using Regional Climate Models (RCMs) linked to hydrological models, applied to the analysis of runoff under conditions of convective activity and extreme precipitation, in regions of complex topography, or stakeholder-driven investigations such as water runoff simulations in Quebec undertaken for a major utility. Thorough analyses of GCM results for the Century were reported at the Workshop, in order to illustrate the improvements in model results which have taken place in recent years, and the increasing confidence with which the models can be used for projecting climatic change in coming decades. However, there is still much room for improvement; there is also a need to address more fully the manner in which climate and impacts models (e. g. , hydrological models) can be linked, in terms of consistency and the overlap between different scales, the underlying physical assumptions, and the parameterizations used. Session 2 was devoted to the two extremes of water resources, namely floods and droughts, the focus here being to identify the climate change component in river floods. These have significant economic implications, as was shown by several scientists from Western and Central Europe.

The International Symposium of Acoustical Imaging has been widely recognized as the premier forum for presentations of advanced research results in both theoretical and experimental development. Held regularly since 1968, the symposium brings together th leading international researchers in the area of acoustical imaging. The 24 meeting is the third time Santa Barbara hosted this international conference and it is the first time the meeting was held on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara. As many regular participants noticed over the years, this symposium has grown significantly in size due to the quality of the presentations as well as the organization itself. A few years ago multiple and poster sessions were introduced in order to accommodate this growth. In addition, the length of the presentations was shortened so more papers could be included in the sessions. During recent meetings there were discussions regarding the possibility of returning to the wonderful years when the symposium was organized in one single session with sufficient time to allow for in-depth presentation as well as discussions of each paper. And the size of the meeting was small enough that people were able to engage in serious technical interactions and all attendees would fit into one photograph. In light of the constraints of the limited budget with respect to the escalating costs it was not considered feasible.

Advances in nanoscale science show that the properties of many materials are dominated by internal structures. In molecular cases, such as window glass and proteins, these internal structures obviously have a network character. However, in many partly disordered electronic materials, almost all attempts at understanding are based on traditional continuum models. This workshop focuses first on the phase diagrams and phase transitions of materials known to be composed of molecular networks. These phase properties characteristically contain remarkable features, such as intermediate phases that lead to reversibility windows in glass transitions as functions of composition. These features arise as a result of self-organization of the internal structures of the intermediate phases. In the protein case, this self-organization is the basis for protein folding. The second focus is on partly disordered electronic materials whose phase properties exhibit the same remarkable features. In fact, the phenomenon of High Temperature Superconductivity, discovered by Bednorz and Mueller in 1986, and now the subject of 75,000 research papers, also arises from such an intermediate phase. More recently discovered electronic phenomena, such as giant magnetoresistance, also are made possible only by the existence of such special phases. This book gives an overview of the methods and results obtained so far by studying the characteristics and properties of nanoscale self-organized networks. It demonstrates the universality of the network approach over a range of disciplines, from protein folding to the newest electronic materials.", "title_en": "Phase Transitions and Self-Organization in Electronic and Molecular Networks"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4189670-1", "gnd:4154189-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2001", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Nowhere on Earth is the challenge for ecological understanding greater, and yet more urgent, than in those parts of the globe where human activity is most intense - cities. People need to understand how cities work as ecological systems so they can take control of the vital links between human actions and environmental quality, and work for an ecologically and economically sustainable future. An ecosystem approach integrates biological, physical and social factors and embraces historical and geographical dimensions, providing our best hope for coping with the complexity of cities. This book is a first of its kind effort to bring together leaders in the biological, physical and social dimensions of urban ecosystem research with leading education researchers, administrators and practitioners, to show how an understanding of urban ecosystems is vital for urban dwellers to grasp the fundamentals of ecological and environmental science, and to understand their own environment.

Doria 6, 95125 Catania, Italy Soil-Structure Interaction is a challenging multidisciplinary subject which covers several areas of Civil Engineering. Virtually every construction is connected to the ground and the interaction between the artefact and the foundation medium may affect considerably both the superstructure and the foundation soil. The Soil-Structure Interaction problem has become an important feature of Structural Engineering with the advent of massive constructions on soft soils such as nuclear power plants, concrete and earth dams. Buildings, bridges, tunnels and underground structures may also require particular attention to be given to the problems of Soil-Structure Interaction. Dynamic Soil-Structure Interaction is prominent in Earthquake Engineering problems. The complexity of the problem, due also to its multidisciplinary nature and to the fact of having to consider bounded and unbounded media of different mechanical characteristics, requires a numerical treatment for any application of engineering significance. The Boundary Element Method appears to be well suited to solve problems of Soil- Structure Interaction through its ability to discretize only the boundaries of complex and often unbounded geometries. Non-linear problems which often arise in Soil-Structure Interaction may also be treated advantageously by a judicious mix of Boundary and Finite Element discretizations.", "title_en": "Boundary Element Methods for Soil-Structure Interaction"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4076508-8", "gnd:4609069-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2003", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1784465518", "content": {"text": "In search of the culprit : aspects of medieval authorship. Despite various poststructuralist rejections of the idea of a singular author-genius, the question of a textual archetype that can be assigned to a named author is still a common scholarly phantasm. The Romantic idea that an author created a text or even a work autonomously is transferred even to pre-modern literature today. This ignores the fact that the transmission of medieval and early modern literature creates variances that could not be justified by means of singular authorships. The present volume offers new theoretical approaches from English, German, and Scandinavian studies to provide a historically more adequate approach to the question of authorship in premodern literary cultures. Authorship is no longer equated with an extra-textual entity, but is instead considered a narratological, inner- and intertextual function that can be recognized in the retrospectively established beginnings of literature as well as in the medial transformation of texts during the early days of printing. The volume is aimed at interested scholars of all philologies, especially those dealing with the Middle Ages or Early Modern Period", "title_en": "In search of the culprit : aspects of medieval authorship"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4130545-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:10095502-2", "year": "2021", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The focus of this volume is on the aesthetics, semantics and function of materials in Roman antiquity between the 2nd century B.C. and the 2nd century A.D. It includes contributions on both architectural spaces (and their material design) and objects – types of 'artefacts' that differ greatly in the way they were used, perceived and loaded with cultural significance. With respect to architecture, the analysis of material aesthetics leads to a new understanding of the performance, imitation and transformation of surfaces, including the social meaning of such strategies. In the case of objects, surface treatments are equally important. However, object form (a specific design category), which can enter into tension with materiality, comes into particular focus. Only when materials are shaped do their various qualities emerge, and these qualities are, to a greater or lesser extent, transferred to objects. With a focus primarily on Roman Italy, the papers in this volume underscore the importance of material design and highlight the awareness of this matter in the ancient world", "title_en": "Materiality in Roman Art and Architecture : Aesthetics, Semantics and Function"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4002851-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2021", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Cartography originated in ancient times to represent the world and to enable circulation, communication, and economic exchange. Today, IT companies are a driving force in this field and change our view of the world; how we communicate, navigate, and consume globally. Questions of privacy, authorship, and economic interests are highly relevant to cartography's practices. So how to deal with such powers and what is the critical role of cartography in it?

What can be understood by spatial transformation, how does it manifest itself and what are the characteristics of transformation processes? This Research Report addresses these questions and presents current research projects and approaches from an academic and practical (planning) perspective. A central point of reference is the concept of a \"Great Transformation\", which stems from an expert report by the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU). It outlines the profound changes in the economy and society towards sustainability that will become necessary in the future, describing them as a \"Great Transformation\". Likewise, social upheavals also manifest themselves in space, enabling spatial changes to be understood as spatial transformations. However, on a detailed level it remains unclear what is to be understood by spatial transformation processes and how they manifest themselves. Against the background of this need for (further) research, this Research Report addresses concrete issues in the research and shaping of spatial transformation processes. The aim is to systematise the largely unordered or disordered knowledge of spatial transformation processes and to contribute to a common understanding of the associated concepts, which can form the basis for further research and for the steering of these processes. The articles on the following topics show how spatial and social transformation processes are mutually dependent and what opportunities and challenges inter- and transdisciplinary research designs can offer in this context: Perspectives on transformation processes; Social and settlement structures in change; Regional development and innovation; Transformation processes in the so-called Global South; New challenges for planning, processes and stakeholders; Research on transformation. The contributions to theoretical, methodological and practical approaches are intended to stimulate a critical discussion on spatial transformation that is open to new, interdisciplinary perspectives.", "title_en": "Spatial transformation : processes, strategies, research design"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4451062-7", "gnd:4048561-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1195168403; gnd:1195167679; gnd:120532092X", "year": "2022", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The investigation of light-matter interactions in materials, especially those on the nanoscale, represents perhaps the most promising avenue for scientific progress in the fields of photonics and plasmonics. This book examines a variety of topics, starting from fundamental principles, leading to the current state of the art research. For example, this volume includes a chapter on the sensing of biological molecules with optical resonators (microspheres) combined with plasmonic systems, where the response this system are described in a fundamental and elegant manner using coupled mode theory. Symmetry plays a major role in the book. One chapter on time reversal symmetry in electromagnetic theory describes how to control the properties of light (e.g. scattering and directionality of the flow of light) in materials with certain topological invariants. Another chapter where symmetry is prominent reformulates, using a gentle and pedagogical approach, Maxwell’s Equations into a new set of fields that reveal a “handedness” symmetry in electromagnetic theory, which can be applied to photonic systems in, for example, the sensing of chiral molecules and understanding the conditions for zero reflection. Also, for students and researchers starting in the field of nanoplasmonics, the book includes a tutorial on the finite element time domain simulation of nanoplasmonic systems. Other topics include photonic systems for quantum computing, nanoplasmonics, and optical properties of nano and bulk materials. The authors take a pedagogical approach to their topic, making the book an excellent reference for graduate students and scientists starting in the fields of photonics or plasmonics.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1810542979", "content": {"text": "Preservation, sustainability, and equity. Heritage occupies a privileged position within the built environment. Most municipalities in the United States, and nearly all countries around the world, have laws and policies to preserve heritage in situ, seeking to protect places from physical loss and the forces of change. That privilege, however, is increasingly being unsettled by the legacies of racial, economic, and social injustice in both the built environment and historic preservation policy, and by the compounding climate crisis. Though many heritage projects and practitioners are confronting injustice and climate in innovative ways, systemic change requires looking beyond the formal and material dimensions of place and to the processes and outcomes of preservation policy-operationalized through laws and guidelines, regulatory processes, and institutions-across time and socio-geographic scales, and in relation to the publics they are intended to serve. This third volume in the Issues in Preservation Policy series examines historic preservation as an enterprise of ideas, methods, institutions, and practices that must reorient toward a new horizon, one in which equity and sustainability become critical guideposts for policy evolution.

Serious Fun is about architecture and urban design games that have been conceived and created by architects, urban designers, artists and game developers since the end of the twentieth century -- from doll's houses to construction games and city building games, from SimCity to Block by Block. The games are looked at from both a game technical and an architectural-critical point of view. As much attention is paid to the games themselves (the way they look, their construction and rules) as to their playing -- in particular, to the space that players receive or take for their personal, spontaneous, unexpected and especially subversive moves and ideas. What perception of, and interaction with, the built environment do they express? What messages do the games communicate? How critical and innovative are the underlying concepts: Are stereotypes confirmed or broken? Do they address environmental and social issues? Serious Fun presents games and playfulness as serious tools for every architect and urban designer. This book concludes a triptych about alternative forms of representation and communication in architecture and urban design.

The first monographic publication in English on German expressionist artist and architect Paul Goesch, whose extraordinary architectural fantasies were produced while he was institutionalized for schizophrenia. Artist and architect Paul Goesch (1885–1940) created one of the most inventive, peculiar, and poignant bodies of work to emerge from Weimar Germany. His vibrant drawings teem with invented ornament and resemble little else made then or since. Goesch, who exhibited widely in avant-garde circles, did so while institutionalized for schizophrenia—a condition for which he was ultimately murdered by the Nazi regime. This monograph makes Goesch’s extraordinary creations accessible to an English-speaking audience for the first time. It presents more than thirty examples of his drawings from the collection of the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal, as well as work by his peers in the Expressionist “Glass Chain” group. Goesch’s subject matter is mainly arches, passageways, and portals, which are taken here as a metaphor for the artist’s anthroposophic beliefs and altered states and his liminal status as both an insider and outsider, whom critics have never been able to categorize clearly. The authors discuss Goesch’s production and reception and posit his enduring art historical significance.", "title_en": "Portals : the visionary architecture of Paul Goesch"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4068827-6", "gnd:4174123-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1056275-8", "year": "2023", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The first publication to catalog the complete works of architect and arts advocate Alfred Preis, a Viennese modernist who fled Nazi-occupied Austria and transformed regional Hawaiian architecture, with his best-known project being the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor.0Architect, planner, and arts advocate Alfred Preis (1911-1994) dedicated his many creative talents to his beloved, adopted home, Hawai'i. Born to a Jewish family, raised, and educated in Vienna, Preis became an exile after escaping from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1939 and briefly being interned as an \"enemy alien\" when the United States entered World War II. Preis emerged as one of Hawai'i's leading modern architects in the 1950s and 1960s. His celebrated architectural career spanned twenty-three years. In this time, he designed almost one hundred and eighty completed projects ranging from residences, schools, commercial buildings, and public parks. His new, regionalist vision for architecture and planning were specific to the Hawaiian context, its people, its tropical climate, and its stunning landscape. Preis's crowning achievement was his design for the famed USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor in 1962. 0This is the first publication to examine Alfred Preis's body of work in architecture, which spans from 1939 to 1963, including not only several acclaimed public projects but also illustrating the transition from a European modern language into a regional modernism, unifying both cultures in distinct and pioneering ways. 0In later years through his legislative work, Alfred Preis became a visionary advocate and leader for the public arts, creating the first 1% law in the United States, which stipulated that 1% of all public building construction be used for the purchase of public art", "title_en": "Alfred Preis displaced : the tropical modernism of the Austrian emigrant and architect of the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4002851-3", "gnd:4120507-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2022", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The critical concern of the book Utopia Computer is the euphoria, expectation and hope inspired by the introduction of computers within architecture in the early digital age. With the advent of the personal computer and the launch of the Internet in the 1990s, utopian ideals found in architectural discourse from the 1960s were revisited and adjusted to the specific characteristics of digital media. Taking the 1990s discourse on computation as a starting point, the contributions of this book grapple with the utopian promises associated with topics such as participation, self-organization, and non-standard architecture.

This volume seeks to (re)situate monuments from the 14th-16th centuries that are indebted to medieval building practices and designs within the more established narratives of art and architectural history. Drawing on case studies from Cyprus to the Dominican Republic, the book explores historiographical, methodological, and theoretical concerns related to the study of medieval architecture, bringing to the fore the meanings and functions of the Gothic in specific contexts of use and display. The development of local styles relative to competing traditions, and instances of coexistence and hybridization, are considered in relation to workshop practices and design theory, the role of ornament, the circulation of people and knowledge, spatial experiences, as well as notions of old and new.

A cross-cultural, comparative view on the transition from a predominant ‘culture of handwriting’ to a predominant ‘culture of print’ in the late medieval and early modern periods is provided here, combining research on Christian and Jewish European book culture with findings on East Asian manuscript and print culture. This approach highlights interactions and interdependencies instead of retracing a linear process from the manuscript book to its printed successor.While each chapter is written as a disciplinary study focused on one specific case from the respective field, the volume as a whole allows for transcultural perspectives. It thereby not only focusses on change, but also on simultaneities of manuscript and printing practices as well as on shifts in the perception of media, writing surfaces, and materials: Which values did writers, printers, and readers attribute to the handwritten and printed materials? For which types of texts was handwriting preferred or perceived as suitable? How and under which circumstances could handwritten and printed texts coexist, even within the same document, and which epistemic dynamics emerged from such textual assemblages?", "title_en": "Between manuscript and print : transcultural perspectives, ca. 1400-1800"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4038971-6", "gnd:4008598-3", "gnd:4008639-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:10095502-2", "year": "2023", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This proceedings volume presents a selection of peer-reviewed contributions from the Second Non-Associative Algebras and Related Topics (NAART II) conference, which was held at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, from July 18–22, 2022. The conference was held in honor of mathematician Alberto Elduque, who has made significant contributions to the study of non-associative structures such as Lie, Jordan, and Leibniz algebras. The papers in this volume are organized into four parts: Lie algebras, superalgebras, and groups; Leibniz algebras; associative and Jordan algebras; and other non-associative structures. They cover a variety of topics, including classification problems, special maps (automorphisms, derivations, etc.), constructions that relate different structures, and representation theory. One of the unique features of NAART is that it is open to all topics related to non-associative algebras, including octonion algebras, composite algebras, Banach algebras, connections with geometry, applications in coding theory, combinatorial problems, and more. This diversity allows researchers from a range of fields to find the conference subjects interesting and discover connections with their own areas, even if they are not traditionally considered non-associative algebraists. Since its inception in 2011, NAART has been committed to fostering cross-disciplinary connections in the study of non-associative structures.", "title_en": "Non-associative algebras and related topics : NAART II, Coimbra, Portugal, July 18-22, 2022"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4130355-6", "gnd:4297760-5", "gnd:4304028-7", "gnd:4134656-7", "gnd:4162770-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1010568-2; gnd:1305699254", "year": "2023", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Studies on ancient urbanity either concerns individual buildings or the city as a whole. This volume, instead, addresses a meso-scale of urbanity: the socio-spatial organisation of ancient cities. Its temporal focus is on Late Republican and Imperial Italy, and more specifically the cities of Pompeii and Ostia. Referring to a praxeological and phenomenological perspective, it looks at neighbourhoods and city quarters as basic categories of design and experience. With the terms ‘neighbourhood and ‘city quarter’ the volume proposes two different methodological approaches: Neighbourhood here refers to the face-to-face relation between people living next to each other – thus the small-scale environment centred around a house and an individual. Neighbourhoods thus do not constitute a (collectively defined) urban territory with clear borders, but are rather constituted by individual experiences. In contrast, city quarters are understood as areas that share certain characteristics", "title_en": "Neighbourhoods and city quarters in antiquity : design and experience"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4077814-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1302481134", "year": "2023", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The book provides new perspectives from leading experts examining the role of architects and urbanists in designing for inclusivity in our built environment. By focusing on themes of gender, race and ethnicity, ability, neurodiversity, age, poverty and socio-economy and the non-human, the book tackles the complex challenges that designers and scholars encounter and need to address in their works. The volume offers a diverse compilation of peer-reviewed papers related to architecture for inclusivity in various different formats, ranging from visual essays, argumentative papers and scholastic texts. It presents the notion of \"availability\", a concept which works to challenge the \"othering\" inherent in notions of inclusion and accessibility. In its introduction it presents a critical discourse around the challenges and potentials lying in the design for availability targeted towards a systemic change of our societies. The book is part of a series of six volumes that explore the agency of the built environment in relation to the SDGs through new research conducted by leading researchers.

The essays in this volume address the problem of three dimensions in architecture and the ways architects in the 16th century (and before and after) solved this problem during the design process. Two-dimensional drawings were used as the most helpful element in the design process, as well as for the presentation of designs. Those involved, not only patrons but also construction workers, should be able to understand what a two-dimensional design would turn out to result in three dimensions. Both drawings in two dimensions and three-dimensional models are well-known tools to architects, but the way in which they employed them together is not always clear. Sometimes architects limited themselves to the making of models only when they believed that these would suffice to communicate the design to others. In other instances, drawings and models were used jointly.

This volume brings together theoretical analyses and recent empirical findings related to the social impact of communication on platforms and its ethical problems. This includes possible ‘ideal’ platforms from an ethical perspective, data management of digital platforms, forms of human–machine communication, local communication in democracies, journalism and vulnerable target groups on platforms, algorithm-driven news selection on platforms and problematic social media forms of communication. The book’s target audience is communication scholars, students and citizens interested in this subject who interact with digital platforms.

This book investigates the implications of digital technologies on the industrial and business dynamics of modern economies. In-depth studies analyse how deep-rooted work practices of the Old Economy have been dramatically challenged when confronted with the entrepreneurial wave of the New Economy. Initially the digitization of existing processes was motivated by ideas of rationalization and cost-cutting. The book convincingly shows how reaping the full benefits necessitates fundamental changes in procedures and organizational design. The effects transcend the boundaries of the firm, as established channels of interaction with old partners must be reconfigured and familiar divisions of labour rethought. The Industrial Dynamics of the New Digital Economy presents novel and detailed data showing how vast and still dominant industries of the Old Economy have responded to the new challenges and exploited the emerging opportunities of digitization in very different ways. The book offers the first theoretical framework for analysing and evaluating the different strategies chosen by industries when struggling to rebuild competitive positions in the new digitized business environment and will be of great value to academics, industrial economists and all those interested in technology, innovation and the new economy", "title_en": "The industrial dynamics of the new digital economy"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4013384-9", "gnd:4026926-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Edward Elgar Publishing", "year": "2003", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Since the 1980s there has been a renewed interest in attempts to introduce a sense of history into economic literature. In this book, the authors argue that it is not possible to explain a state of the world without first analysing the processes that lead to that state. The contributions collected in this volume share a critical stance towards the timelessness and a historical theorizing of mainstream economics. Past states in the development of an economic process set the range of possibilities for future development and can be used to construct theories based on the irreversibility of economic time. Many of these notable contributors argue that the study of the history of economic thought is important in two ways. Firstly, because it provides important insights into the ways that economists of the past attempted to address the problems of history and secondly, because it helps us to understand the present state of economics as being itself the outcome of a path dependent process. Evolutionary economists, economic theorists and historians, as well as economists interested in the evolution of economic and other social institutions, will find this challenging collection of papers essential reading", "title_en": "Evolution and path dependence in economic ideas : past and present"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4132813-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy; Edward Elgar Publishing", "year": "2001", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This important new book presents a state-of-the-art assessment of how economic models can be used by different levels of government to combat environmental problems. It considers policies for climate change and transport that can be used at federal and confederal levels of government. The authors examine the unique aspects of environmental policy making in a multi-layered government using empirical case studies covering Europe and the US. They consider the causes of pollution at three levels - federal government, local government and industries and firms. Concentrating on greenhouse gas abatement and the transport sector, they use quantitative techniques to compare alternative policy solutions. This quantitative approach overcomes problems of some inconclusive theoretical prescriptions, which often depend on combinations of particular parameter values. In addition, this method makes it possible to investigate the costs and benefits of a particular solution, and the distribution effects between different groups. This approach also provides insights into the economic consequences of the application of local versus national or federal policies. Climate Change, Transport and Environmental Policy provides the necessary analysis required for environmental policy making in that it uses a quantitative approach to balance the costs and benefits of alternative policy options. Climate Change, Transport and Environmental Policy is an important addition to the literature and will be welcomed by environmental policymakers at the local, regional, national and international level as well as scholars and postgraduate students in environmental economics and public policy", "title_en": "Climate change, transport, and environmental policy : empirical applications in a federal system"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4062901-6", "gnd:4060680-6", "gnd:4164199-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Edward Elgar Publishing", "year": "1998", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The Economics of Knowledge Sharing claims that useful economic knowledge is the most important foundation for the development of a sufficiently strong process of innovation. Within the framework of new institutional economics, the book looks at the institutional conditions required for the interactive sharing and dissemination of knowledge in the development of economies. It outlines in four distinct parts the complex societal process of human interaction by which knowledge is effectively generated and used. The book first considers knowledge sharing institutions, differentiating between types of interaction and types of actors. Secondly, it examines the economic role of knowledge and cognition, asking how and why human actors gather knowledge. It goes on to revisit historical questions of knowledge and embeds them within the contemporary debate, before finally reflecting on the significant relationship between technology and knowledge sharing in the digital age. Opening up a new area of research encompassing the institutional framework of the innovation process, this pathbreaking volume will be of enormous interest to a wide-ranging audience including economists in the fields of theory, innovation research, new institutional economics, evolutionary economics, history of economic thought, and education policy.

The use of molecular variation as the basis of naming or selecting target taxa and some strategic decisions about genetic variance maximization in the conserved population or community units are analyzed. Several case studies and scenarios illustrate the application of genetic information in conservation practices.", "title_en": "Conservation genetics"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4128987-0", "gnd:4131912-6", "gnd:4312811-7", "gnd:4046804-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5148304-X", "year": "1994", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A324250479", "content": {"text": "Financial crises in transition countries : recent lessons and problems yet to solve ; conference proceedings. ince the beginning of 1997, a currency and/or banking crisis broke out in several transition countries (Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine). In 1995, Hungary avoided a financial crisis by adjusting properly her macroeconomic policies. Financial markets in transition countries are still small. They gain, however, more and more importance for the entire economy. Part of the countries mentioned are candidates for EU membership. They have to show their ability to stabilize their exchange rates and financial sectors. The fact that overcoming the financial crisis in Asia and Latin America required international assistance (e.g. IMF) underlines the political importance of strategies of preventing such crises in the EU's immediate neighborhood. Against this background, the Halle Institute for Economic Research (IWH) and the Centre for European Integration Studies Bonn (ZEI) organized a conference on 'Financial crises in transition countries: recent lessons and problems yet to solve'. The conference took place on 13/14 July 2000 in Halle. The organizers invited papers that are theoretical or empirical/policy oriented and offer a critical and up-to-date insight into a field that may gain more evidence in the future. Most of the papers present new results of empirical and theoretical research. This volume presents some of the papers.", "title_en": "Financial crises in transition countries : recent lessons and problems yet to solve ; conference proceedings"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4023023-5", "gnd:4033203-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1302435-8", "year": "2000", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Since Instructional Design (ID) has been an established discipline in European countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium or the United Kingdom for more than 20 years, it seems only natural that it is getting more and more important in the German-speaking countries as well. In order to produce efficient learning environments for multimedia learning, systematic planning is necessary. At this point, Instructional Design - based on the ideas Robert M. Gagné developed more than fifty years ago - seems to offer interesting solutions. The process of designing and developing such environments includes strategic decisions concerning the technical base or the overall pedagogical orientation and ending in the choice between fonts and colours. ID is also concerned with methods and tools to support design activities, organizational aspects, the competencies and attitudes of the designers, variables of the context, problems of the dissemination and implementation of new educational procedures as well as the questions raised by the efforts to evaluate different aspects of e-learning in all its variants. The contributions to the 5th International Workshop of the SIG 6 \"Instructional Design\" of the European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction (EARLI) in Erfurt in 2002 compiled in this volume try to offer some solutions and raise new questions. A lot more empirical research remains to be done and there is still a lack of new theoretical models.

The geometric approach to the algebraic theory of quadratic forms is the study of projective quadrics over arbitrary fields. Function fields of quadrics have been central to the proofs of fundamental results since the 1960's. Recently, more refined geometric tools have been brought to bear on this topic, such as Chow groups and motives, and have produced remarkable advances on a number of outstanding problems. Several aspects of these new methods are addressed in this volume, which includes an introduction to motives of quadrics by A. Vishik, with various applications, notably to the splitting patterns of quadratic forms, papers by O. Izhboldin and N. Karpenko on Chow groups of quadrics and their stable birational equivalence, with application to the construction of fields withu-invariant 9, and a contribution in French by B.

This publication presents the current situation with regard to the magnitude and economic impact of migrants remittances to their countries of origin. In 2004, remittances exceeded official development aid in several emigration countries: they totalled USD 126 billion according to IMF estimates. The book surveys the channels used to collect these funds; the role of banking systems and other financial institutions; the introduction of new technologies and their impact on fund collection; how the funds are transferred; and how to reduce the costs. Focus is also placed on the different ways in which migrants themselves participate -- together with non-governmental organizations, host countries and sending countries -- to open up new avenues for policies on development aid and co-development. The direct role that migrants can play at the local level is highlighted. Several countries and regions are illustrated: Southern European countries, Mexico, Turkey, North African and sub-Saharan African countries, the Philippines and some Latin American countries.--Publisher summary", "title_en": "Migration, remittances and development : [international conference jointly organised by the OECD and the Central Popular Bank of Morocco, with the support of the Agence Française de Développment, on migration, remittances and the economic development of sending countries, held in February 2005 in Marrakech]"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4076605-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5157-3", "year": "2005", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The request to organize under its patronage at Poitiers in 1998 a Symposium entitled “Advanced Optical Methods and Applications in Solid Mechanics” by the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (I.U.T.A.M.) was well received for the following two reasons. First, for nearly 20 years no Symposium devoted to optical methods in solids had been organized. Second, recent advances in digital image processing provided many new applications which are described in the following. We have the honour to present here the proceedings of this Symposium. st th The Symposium took place from august 31 to September 4 at the Institut International de la Prospective in Futuroscope near Poitiers. A significant number of internationally renowned specialists had expressed their wish to participate in this meeting. The Scientific Committee proposed 16 general conferences and selected 33 regular lectures and 17 poster presentations. Papers corresponding to posters are not differentiated in the proceedings from those that were presented orally. It is worth noting that a total of 80 participants, representing 16 countries, registered for this symposium..

The last two years have witnessed a continuation in the breakthrough shift toward pulse tube cryocoolers for long-life, high-reliability cryocooler applications. One class of pulse tubes that has reached maturity is referred to as “Stirling type” because they are based on the linear Oxford Stirling-cooler type compressor; these generally provide cooling in the 30 to 100 K temperature range and operate at frequencies from 30 to 60 Hz. The other type of pulse tube cooler making great advances is the so-called “Gifford-McMahon type. ” Pulse tube coolers of this type use a G-M type compressor and lower frequency operation to achieve temperatures in the 2 to 10 K temperature range. Nearly a third of this proceedings covers these new developments in the pulse tube arena. Complementing the work on low-temperature pulse tubes is substantial continued progress on rare earth regenerator materials and Gifford-McMahon coolers. These technologies continue to make great progress in opening up the 2 - 4 K market. Also in the commercial sector, continued interest is being shown in the development of long-life, low-cost cryocoolers for the emerging high temperature superconductor electronics market, particularly the cellular telephone base-station market. At higher temperature levels, closed-cycle J-T or throttle-cycle refrigerators are taking advantage of mixed refrigerant gases to achieve low-cost cryocooler systems in the 65 to 80 K temperature range.

The articles focus on new developments in the field of large-eddy simulation of complex flows and are related to the topics: modelling and analysis of subgrid scales, numerical issues in LES cartesian grids for complex geometries, curvilinear and non-structured grids for complex geometries. DES and RANS-LES coupling, aircraft wake vortices, combustion and magnetohydrodynamics. Progress has been made not only in understanding and modelling the dynamics of unresolved scales, but also in designing means that prevent the contamination of LES predictions by discretization errors. Progress is reported as well on the use of cartesian and curvilinear coordinates to compute flow in and around complex geometries and in the field of LES with unstructured grids. A chapter is dedicated to the detached-eddy simulation technique and its recent achievements and to the promising technique of coupling RANS and LES solutions in order to push the resolution-based Reynolds number limit of wall-resolving LES to higher values. Complexity due to physical mechanisms links the last two chapters. It is shown that LES constitutes the tool to analyse the physics of aircraft wake vortices during landing and takeoff. Its thorough understanding is a prerequisite for reliable predictions of the distance between consecutive landing airplanes. Subgrid combustion modelling for LES of single and two-phase reacting flows is demonstrated to have the potential to deal with finite-rate kinetics in high Reynolds number flows of full-scale gas turbine engines. Fluctuating magnetic fields are more reliably predicted by LES when tensor-diffusivity rather than gradient-diffusion models are used.

The present symposium concentrated on the solid mechanics - main of biomechanics, where important problems of synthesis presently are an active and challenging part. Characteristics of biomechanical materials are not only the inhomogeneity and anisotropy, but also the capability to change in relation to actual use. These living materials call for new methods of analysis and also new methods for synthesis. By the synthesis in this context is meant design of implants or artificial control of material growth. Bone mechanics is closely related to recent work on analysis and design of microstructural anisotropic materials. Also, recent work in shape design can to some extent be useful in the more complicated problems of biomechanics. Here interface problems play an essential role.

Reports that heat processing of foods induces the formation of acrylamide heightened interest in the chemistry, biochemistry, and safety of this compound. Acrylamide-induced neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity are potential human health risks based on animal studies. Because exposure of humans to acrylamide can come from both external sources and the diet, there exists a need to develop a better understanding of its formation and distribution in food and its role in human health. To contribute to this effort, experts from eight countries have presented data on the chemistry, analysis, metabolism, pharmacology, and toxicology of acrylamide. Specifically covered are the following aspects: exposure from the environment and the diet, biomarkers of exposure, risk assessment, epidemiology, mechanism of formation in food, biological alkylation of amino acids, peptides, proteins, and DNA by acrylamide and its epoxide metabolite glycidamide, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and carcinogenicity, protection against adverse effects, and possible approaches to reducing levels in food. Cross-fertilization of ideas among several disciplines in which an interest in acrylamide has developed, including food science, pharmacology, toxicology, and medicine, will provide a better understanding of the chemistry and biology of acrylamide in food, and can lead to the development of food processes to decrease the acrylamide content of the diet. Interest in the chemistry, biochemistry, and safety of acrylamide is running high. These proceedings contain presentations by experts from eight countries on the chemistry, analysis, metabolism, pharmacology, and toxicology of the compound.", "title_en": "Chemistry and Safety of Acrylamide in Food"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4323198-6", "gnd:4034870-2", "gnd:4054790-5", "gnd:4034873-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2005", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Several long-term trends in technology evolution have become apparent since these symposia began in 1989. Earlier presenters more frequently discussed treatment methods involving harsh and extensive human intervention.

Such methods include subsurface-engineered barriers, phytoremediation, and bioremediation. Nineteen manuscripts were selected for inclusion in this volume, based upon peer review, scientific merit, the editors' perceptions of lasting value or innovative features, and the general applicability of either the technology itself or the scientific methods and scholarly details provided by the authors.

During the last decades, continuum mechanics of porous materials has achieved great attention, since it allows for the consideration of the volumetrically coupled behaviour of the solid matrix deformation and the pore-fluid flow. Naturally, applications of porous media models range from civil and environmental engineering, where, e. g. , geote- nical problems like the consolidation problem are of great interest, via mechanical engineering, where, e. g. , the description of sinter materials or polymeric and metallic foams is a typical problem, to chemical and biomechanical engineering, where, e. g. , the complex structure of l- ing tissues is studied. Although these applications are principally very different, they basically fall into the category of multiphase materials, which can be described, on the macroscale, within the framework of the well-founded Theory of Porous Media (TPM). With the increasing power of computer hardware together with the rapidly decreasing computational costs, numerical solutions of complex coupled problems became possible and have been seriously investigated. However, since the quality of the numerical solutions strongly depends on the quality of the underlying physical model together with the experimental and mathematical possibilities to successfully determine realistic material parameters, a successful treatment of porous materials requires a joint consideration of continuum mechanics, experimental mechanics and numerical methods. In addition, micromechanical - vestigations and homogenization techniques are very helpful to increase the phenomenological understanding of such media.

During September 24-26, 2001, the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands organised the Glare - the New Material for Aircraft Conference, an international conference on the relationship between design, material choice and application of aircraft materials with respect to new developments in industry. Eminent representatives from the aircraft manufacturing world, including manufacturers, airlines, airports, universities, governments and aviation authorities, were present at this conference to meet and exchange ideas - see the group photo on the next two pages. The fact that the conference was held just two weeks after ‘September 11, 2001’ put things in a rather unique perspective. The aim of the conference was to illustrate the many unique applications of the Glare family of fibre metal laminates and to provide for the exchange and distribution of information regarding this material in order to stimulate their acceptance and promote further application. The introduction of fibre metal laminates into the commercial aviation market took about 20 years’ time. Introducing new technologies should not be taken lightly, however; the aircraft industry is by nature rather conservative and innovations must therefore be proven – a paradox actually – in all possible ways before they can be introduced in real aircraft structures. Not only do technical aspects play a role in this respect; historical, cultural, economical and political issues are equally important.

Nanotechnology is rapidly invading many aspects of modern society - from science, research and engineering to industrial and commercial applications and, inevitably, to man and his environment. One of the biggest challenges, therefore, is managing environmental, health and safety risks of nanomaterials. Yet, the information necessary to assess their long term effects is scarce. Systematic research into what potentially makes engineered nanomaterials hazardous, how this translates into risk, and how these can be managed will be vital and involves interdisciplinary collaboration.

The 1999 International Workshop on Interactive Distributed Multimedia Sys­ tems and Telecommunication Services (IDMS) in Toulouse is the sixth in a se­ ries that started in 1992. The previous workshops were held in Stuttgart in 1992, Hamburg in 1994, Berlin in 1996, Darmstadt in 1997, and Oslo in 1998. The area of interest of IDMS ranges from basic system technologies, such as networking and operating system support, to all kinds of teleservices and distributed multimedia applications. Technical solutions for telecommunications and distributed multimedia systems are merging and quality-of-service (QoS) will play a key role in both areas. However, the range from basic system tech­ nologies to distributed mutlimedia applications and teleservices is still very broad and we have to understand the implications of multimedia applications and their requirements for middleware and networks.

This volume contains the contributions presented at the International Workshop on Current Trends in Applied Formal Methods organized October 7-9, 1998, in Boppard, Germany. The main objective of the workshop was to draw a map of the key issues facing the practical application of formal methods in industry. This appears to be particularly timely with safety and security issues becoming a real obstacle to industrial software and hardware development. As a consequence, almost all major companies have now set up departments or groups to work with formal methods and many European countries face a severe labour shortage in this new field. Tony Hoare's prediction of the art of software (and hardware) development becoming a proper engineering science with its own body of tools and techniques is now becoming a reality. So the focus of this application oriented workshop was not so much on spe­ cial academic topics but rather on the many practical aspects of this emerging new technology: verification and validation, and tool support and integration into the software life-cycle. By evaluating the state of the art with respect to industrial applications a discussion emerged among scientists, practising engi­ neers, and members of regulatory and funding agencies about future needs and developments. This discussion lead to roadmaps with respect to the future of this field, to tool support, and potential application areas and promising market segments. The contributions of the participants from industry as well as from the respective national security bureaus were particularly valuable and highly appreciated.", "title_en": "Applied formal methods - FM-trends 98 : International Workshop on Current Trends in Applied Formal Methods, Boppard, Germany, October 7 - 9, 1998 ; proceedings"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4333722-3", "gnd:4159103-3", "gnd:4116522-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:2178574-0", "year": "1999", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The chemistry of carbon nanomaterials and hydrogen materials science will play an important role in hastening the conversion to the Hydrogen Energy System. In this connection the research and application of materials capable of interacting actively with hydrogen, its accumulation and storage will be of the utmost significance. This is particularly relevant for creating mobile energy sources both for mobile telephones and for hybrid electric cars that are developed by all large car manufacturers of the world. In this connection the hydrogen capacity of carbon nanostructural materials, such as fullerenes, nanotubes, nanofibers and other nanostructures, has aroused special interest. Hydriding metals, alloys, nanocarbon and composite materials can store hydrogen safely at relatively low pressures and temperatures. Many other applications are also possible such as heating and cooling, waste heat storage, pumping, pressurizing, heat-pumping, hydrogen purifying, deuterium separation, electricity production, etc. As a source of clean energy, hydrogen will also be the permanent answer to other global problems caused by utilizing fossil fuels, such as the greenhouse effect, climate change, acid rains, ozone layer depletion, pollution and oil spills.", "title_en": "Hydrogen materials science and chemistry of carbon nanomaterials : [proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Hydrogen Materials Science and Chemistry of Carbon Nanomaterials (ICHMS 2005), Sevastopol, Crimea, Ukraine, 5 - 11 September 2005]"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4342626-8", "gnd:4160911-6", "gnd:4070813-5", "gnd:4031677-4", "gnd:4387876-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:10181352-1", "year": "2007", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Nanotechnology is the result of the continuing technological trend toward device miniaturization and the characterization, manipulation, and fine control of structure and function at diminishing length scales. A large class of nanoscale materials can be stable even though they are far from the lowest-energy thermodynamic state, and many possess novel properties unattainable in bulk. These trends are supported by the increasing sophistication of characterization and fabrication tools such as the scanning tunneling microscope and the transmission electron microscope, which allow the resolution and manipulation of single atoms and molecules. Nanoscale Phenomena: Basic Science to Device Applications presents selected lectures from the Third Workshop of the Croucher Advanced Study Institute on Nano Science and Technology, and showcases contributions from world-renowned researchers. Chapters fall into four major categories: Nanostructured Carbon and its Applications, Quantum Dots and Molecular Spintronics, Nanomaterials Design and Synthesis, and Molecular Electronics.", "title_en": "Nanoscale phenomena : basic science to device applications ; [the Third International Workshop of the Croucher Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on Nano Science and Technology: from Basic Science to Device Applications, was held at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology from 8 January to 12 January 2007]"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4342626-8", "gnd:4844582-4", "gnd:4327470-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Tang, Zikang", "year": "2008", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Klappentext: This collection of essays testifies to the profound impact that earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and other such events have had on humans throughout history in every part of the world. Several contributors argue that the experience of catastrophe has changed humans' behavior and perceptions over time without necessarily reducing their degree of exposure or risk. The book includes case studies from Western Europe, Scandinavia, Algeria, the Middle East, China, India, the Philippines, Argentina, Mexico, and the East Coast of the United States, ranging from the medieval through the modern period. While natural disasters occur around the globe, different cultures, societies, and regions have adopted specific methods and technologies for managing local hazards and for surviving catastrophic natural events. Indeed, how humans deal with catastrophes depends largely on social and cultural patterns, values, belief systems, political institutions, and economic structures. The roles that natural disasters play in society and the meanings they are given vary from one political and geographic space to the next. The essays collected here help us to understand not only how people across the centuries have learned to cope with disaster but also how communities in different parts of the world have developed cultural, social, and technological strategies for doing so.", "title_en": "Natural disasters, cultural responses : case studies toward a global environmental history ; [Conference \"Natural Disasters and Cultural Strategies: Responses to Catastrophe in Global Perspective\" at the German Historical Institute in Washington, D.C. in February 2004]"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4061616-2", "gnd:4041387-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5015376-6; gnd:1222526964", "year": "2009", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This fact is demonstrated by the large number of application areas covered in this book (see section on applications of parallel computer architectures). The applications range from image analysis to quantum mechanics and data bases. Still, the use of parallel architectures poses serious problems and requires the development of new techniques and tools. This book is a collection of best papers presented at the first workshop on two major research activities at the Universitiit Erlangen-Niirnberg and Technis­ che Universitiit Miinchen. At both universities, more than 100 researchers are working in the field of multiprocessor systems and network configurations and methods and tools for parallel systems. Indeed, the German Science Founda­ tion (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) has been sponsoring the projects under grant numbers SFB 182 and SFB 342. Research grants in the form of a Sonder­ forschungsbereich are given to selected German Universities in portions of three years following a thoroughful reviewing process. The overall duration of such a research grant is restricted to 12 years. The initiative at Erlangen-Niirnberg was started in 1987 and has been headed since this time by Prof. Dr. H. Wedekind. Work at TU-Miinchen began in 1990, head of this initiative is Prof. Dr. A. Bode. The authors of this book are grateful to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for its continuing support in the field of research on parallel processing. The first section of the book is devoted to hardware aspects of parallel systems.

Until recently, governments have measured economic progress by tallying such statistics as GDP, inflation and balance of payments. Today they agree that economic expansion should be socially and environmentally sustainable. Hence measuring progress towards sustainable development is essential to support decision making and inform the public. How should environmental and social outcomes, such as clean air and water, full employment and good health be integrated with measures of economic progress? How will we know about progress towards sustainable transport, agriculture and energy production and use? Towards sustainable development: Indicators to Measure Progress addresses these fundamental questions. The book contains the proceedings of the OECD Conference that was held in Rome in December 1999. It presents the wide range of initiatives and indicators that are already in place, and outlines the challenges that remain in measuring progress towards sustainable development.", "title_en": "Towards Sustainable Development : Indicators to Measure Progress (Proceedings of the Rome Conference)"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4139465-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5157-3", "year": "2000", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

These techniques, and in particular those of low-dimensional statistical models, are instrumental in improving our understanding of emerging fields, such as quantum computing and cryptography, complex systems, and quantum fluids. This book sets these issues into a larger and more coherent theoretical context than is currently available. For instance, understanding the key concepts of quantum entanglement (a measure of information density) necessitates a thorough knowledge of quantum and topological field theory, and integrable models.

This collection of studies of public attitudes to development co-operation in OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Member countries demonstrates that the concept of \"aid fatigue\" is misplaced.

The opinions of policy makers are, therefore, overwhelmingly important and development education efforts should be specifically addressed to them. The book also demonstrates that the role of NGOs is important in general development education. Not only do these organisations mobilise their members in the development field, but their activities create a fund of information within their societies. Remarkable progress by both governments and NGOs has been made during the 1990s in improving co-operation domestically and in operational development activities in the field. Most DAC Member countries have significantly increased the involvement of NGOs in their development efforts, and most NGOs have become increasingly effective in their work.

Some very large multinational transport and logistics firms have emerged to provide integrated transport services to shippers in the globalised economy. Do these firms escape regulatory oversight from national competition authorities because of their sheer scale? Do they pose additional threats to competition when they merge with or acquire other companies in the supply chain? The Round Table brought competition experts together with researchers on maritime shipping, rail freight and logistics to identify critical competition issues and appropriate regulatory responses. An examination of the strategies of transport and logistics companies reveals that vertical integration can yield efficiencies, but usually reflects a need to improve the use of expensive fixed assets rather than control all parts of the supply chain. This usually explains why shipping lines acquire terminal operators. Horizontal acquisitions, where similar companies serving the same market merge, are more likely to raise competition concerns. Problems are particularly prone to arise at bottleneck infrastructure facilities. The Round Table report provides an economic framework for examining competition in global transport and logistics businesses, discusses the adequacy of the remedies available to regulators when competition is threatened, and explores the role of competition authorities and Transport Ministries in ensuring markets are efficient.", "title_en": "Integration and Competition between Transport and Logistics Businesses"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4052371-8", "gnd:4271469-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:16035519-9; gnd:5157-3; gnd:10203009-1", "year": "2010", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

An original motivation for algebraic geometry was to understand curves and surfaces in three dimensions. Recent theoretical and technological advances in areas such as robotics, computer vision, computer-aided geometric design and molecular biology, together with the increased availability of computational resources, have brought these original questions once more into the forefront of research. One particular challenge is to combine applicable methods from algebraic geometry with proven techniques from piecewise-linear computational geometry (such as Voronoi diagrams and hyperplane arrangements) to develop tools for treating curved objects. These research efforts may be summarized under the term nonlinear computational geometry. This volume grew out of an IMA workshop on Nonlinear Computational Geometry in May/June 2007 (organized by I.Z. Emiris, R. Goldman, F. Sottile, T. Theobald) which gathered leading experts in this emerging field. The research and expository articles in the volume are intended to provide an overview of nonlinear computational geometry.

Annotation, Recent initiatives and developments in high temperature technology aim at the exploitation of fuels end processes at the edge of present materials capabilities, driving service temperatures higher and operating within ever more aggressive environmental conditions. The major driving force behind this trend is increased efficiencies and further growing efforts in environmental protection. The key to reliable operation of components for sufficiently long service periods to a large extent lies in the high temperature properties of the materials used, with high temperature corrosion resistance as the major life and performance-limiting factor. As conventional alloy design invariably leads to a compromise between mechanical strength and corrosion resistance industry has turned to coatings to provide improved materials performance. Consequently there is extensive worldwide activity to develop high performance protective coating systems, to prevent or minimise damage by corrosion, as well as by abrasion, wear and erosion at elevated temperature. Many of these systems (which may consist of surface modified bulk materials or genuine coating systems and in some cases also of special alloy approaches) are based on systematic development starting from present theoretical understanding including laboratory data and ending up in tailor-made solutions for industrial applications", "title_en": "Protective systems for high temperature applications : from theory to industrial implementation"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4132415-8", "gnd:4019416-4", "gnd:4180280-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2011", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A649424905", "content": {"text": "Combinatorial scientific computing. \"Foreword the ongoing era of high-performance computing is filled with enormous potential for scientific simulation, but also with daunting challenges. Architectures for high-performance computing may have thousands of processors and complex memory hierarchies paired with a relatively poor interconnecting network performance. Due to the advances being made in computational science and engineering, the applications that run on these machines involve complex multiscale or multiphase physics, adaptive meshes and/or sophisticated numerical methods. A key challenge for scientific computing is obtaining high performance for these advanced applications on such complicated computers and, thus, to enable scientific simulations on a scale heretofore impossible. A typical model in computational science is expressed using the language of continuous mathematics, such as partial differential equations and linear algebra, but techniques from discrete or combinatorial mathematics also play an important role in solving these models efficiently. Several discrete combinatorial problems and data structures, such as graph and hypergraph partitioning, supernodes and elimination trees, vertex and edge reordering, vertex and edge coloring, and bipartite graph matching, arise in these contexts. As an example, parallel partitioning tools can be used to ease the task of distributing the computational workload across the processors. The computation of such problems can be represented as a composition of graphs and multilevel graph problems that have to be mapped to different microprocessors\"--", "title_en": "Combinatorial scientific computing"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4113782-6", "gnd:4338507-2", "gnd:4031824-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2012", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

A later course introduces QCD at finite temperature and density. A broad view of lattice computation from the basics to recent developments was offered in a corresponding course. Extrapolations to physical quark masses and a framework for the parameterization of the low-energy physics by means of effective coupling constants is covered in a lecture on chiral perturbation theory.

From the late sixteenth century until around 1800, new ideas and practices of urban planning and the implementation of public buildings, water works and fortifications from the Low Countries were disseminated across Europe and America. Engineers, mathematicians and other scientists in the Low Countries applied methods of design and land surveying that were gradually assimilated and often modified following exchanges within local practice. In some cases, models were projected onto the existing situation.

Geologists have long grappled with understanding the mechanical origins of rock deformation. Stress regimes control the nucleation, growth and reactivation of faults and fractures; induce seismic activity; affect the transport of magma; and modulate structural permeability, thereby influencing the redistribution of hydrothermal and hydrocarbon fluids. Experimentalists endeavour to recreate deformation structures observed in nature under controlled stress conditions. Earth scientists studying earthquakes will attempt to monitor or deduce stress changes in the Earth as it actively deforms. All are building upon the pioneering research and concepts of Ernest Masson Anderson, dating back to the start of the twentieth century. This volume celebrates Anderson's legacy, with 14 original research papers that examine faulting and seismic hazard; structural inheritance; the role of local and regional stress fields; low angle faults and the role of pore fluids; supplemented by reviews of Andersonian approaches and a reprint of his classic paper of 1905--", "title_en": "Faulting, fracturing and igneous intrusion in the Earth's Crust"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4126818-0", "gnd:4184639-4", "gnd:4146728-0", "gnd:4015169-4", "gnd:4381340-9", "gnd:4409345-7", "gnd:4394048-1", "gnd:4148995-0", "gnd:4237213-6", "gnd:4183400-8", "gnd:4027528-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2012", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The emergence of creative art-based practices, film making, post-disaster designs and slum management, as part of the architecture discourse and curriculum, is an indication of how broad architecture has become, and the extent to which it has already merged peripheral practices into its core. This new volume in the AHRA Critiques Series is a statement about how broad, complex, influential, and, ironically central, architecture has become in the contemporary culture, economy and society, despite the marginal position the profession currently occupies. Peripheries questions and challenges the boundaries of architectural research by bringing together subjects and relevant streams of investigation, some of which rarely feature in architectural research and practice titles. Divided into four themes, Places of Formation and Insight, Practices at the Edge, People on the Margins and Edge Readings, each section presents a selection of high calibre interdisciplinary research papers, from a range of renowned contributors including Stephen Walker, Gerry Adler, Dana Vais and author Glen Patterson. The volume also includes a Dialogue between Murray Fraser, Christine Boyer and Kim Dovey. Each section interrogates a peripheral aspect of the built environment, and brings to the fore peripheral case studies.

This discretization approach is obtained from a multi-scale basis by a tensor product construction and subsequent truncation of the resulting multiresolution series expansion. This volume of LNCSE is a collection of the papers from the proceedings of the workshop on sparse grids and its applications held in Bonn in May 2011.

Approximately 70 scientists and engineers spent 4 days discussing what research was necessary in order to identify the causes and the extent of climatic change, to assess its consequences, and to prepare for mitigative and adaptive measures. Seven working groups were established: Sources and Sinks of Greenhouse Gases; Energy Demand, Energy Supply; Agricultural and Biological Systems; Water Resources; Coastal Hazards; and Geo-engineering. Each working group was asked to identify a set of goals and a set of approaches to accomplish these goals. Common goals and approaches were then identified, and small, interdisciplinary groups were convened to expand upon the various approaches. Some chapters of the present book are updates of chapters from the book Engineering Response to Global Climate Change that was published in 1997. However, in a real sense it is a new book. Several chapters introduce new material. Even so, the general idea is the same: the climate/energy problem has become largely an engineering problem. The book is more about what we as engineers can do to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to climate change. \"--", "title_en": "Engineering response to climate change : [Workshop on the Engineering Response to Global Climate Change: Planning a Research and Development Agenda ; in June 1991]"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4438735-0", "gnd:4164199-1", "gnd:4061650-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2013", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Domain engineering is a set of activities intended to develop, maintain, and manage the creation and evolution of an area of knowledge suitable for processing by a range of software systems. It is of considerable practical significance, as it provides methods and techniques that help reduce time-to-market, development costs, and project risks on one hand, and helps improve system quality and performance on a consistent basis on the other. In this book, the editors present a collection of invited chapters from various fields related to domain engineering. The individual chapters present state-of-the-art research and are organized in three parts. The first part focuses on results that deal with domain engineering in software product lines. The second part describes how domain-specific languages are used to support the construction and deployment of domains.

There are, however, several methods - some old, some new - that have extended its basic concepts to uncountable structures. Unlike in the classical case, however, no single dominant approach has emerged, and different methods reveal different aspects of the computable content of uncountable mathematics. This book contains introductions to eight major approaches to computable uncountable mathematics: descriptive set theory; infinite time Turing machines; Blum-Shub-Smale computability; Sigma-definability; computability theory on admissible ordinals; E-recursion theory; local computability; and uncountable reverse mathematics. This book provides an authoritative and multifaceted introduction to this exciting new area of research that is still in its early stages. It is ideal as both an introductory text for graduate and advanced undergraduate students, and a source of interesting new approaches for researchers in computability theory and related areas.--", "title_en": "Effective mathematics of the uncountable"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4136067-9", "gnd:4114617-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Association for Symbolic Logic", "year": "2013", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

An important remark is that if one considers a dynamical system governed by linear elasticity the choice of Lagrangian coordinates leads to discuss boundary conditions, or boundary control (for example to stabilize), while the choice of Eulerian coordinates lead to a moving boundary and moving domain .

Livestock production systems will only be sustained in the long term if their products continue to meet the demand of consumers. The quality of ruminant carcasses, meat and meat products is of predominant importance in a competitive market where consumers tend to have a preconceived idea about the criteria that define meat quality such as flavour, tenderness, juiciness, smell, colour and texture. The carcass evaluation could be interesting as a precocious classification of the final quality of meat coming from each carcass. Today the quality characteristics of the meat must be different according to its utilisation (supermarket, butcher, catering, refectory, etc.) and so it is very important to choose very early the final destination of the carcass. Obviously, the carcass classification must correlate with meat quality characteristics required by final consumer. Other important factors that have to be taken into account in order to maintain a demand for ruminant meat are safety and traceability. This book reviews the historical and recent developments for carcass evaluation and grading for meat quality assessment in beef and sheep. It places special emphasis on new concepts and approaches to define carcass and meat quality and on the use of modern technologies for composition and quality evaluation. A range of technologies are presented such as ultrasounds and colour reflectance, X-ray computerised tomography, spectral and thermal imaging, image analysis and NIRS. The use of phenotypic markers such as the plasma hormones and genetic markers to predict carcass composition and meat quality are also presented", "title_en": "Evaluation of carcass and meat quality in cattle and sheep : [Session on ‘New Developments in Evaluation of Carcass and Meat Quality in Cattle and Sheep’ organised in the 57th Annual Meeting of the European Association for Animal Production (EAAP) held in Antalya (Turkey) on 17-20 September 2006 ; 23 contributions]"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4136636-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1023474-3", "year": "2007", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Such pattern formation problems are common in practically all systems involving a large number of interacting components. Here, the basic problem is to understand how competing physical forces can shape stable geometries and to explain why nature prefers just these. Motivation for the intensive study of pattern formation phenomena during the past few years derives from an increasing appreciation of the remarkable diversity of behaviour encountered in nonlinear systems and of universal features shared by entire classes of nonlinear processes. As physics copes with ever more ambi­ tious problems in pattern formation, summarizing our present state of knowledge becomes a pressing issue. This volume presents an overview of selected topics in this field of current interest. It deals with theoretical models of pattern formation and with simulations that bridge the gap between theory and experiment. The book is a product of the International Symposium on the Physics of Structure Formation, held from October 27 through November 2, 1986, at the Institute for Information Sciences of the University of Tiibingen.

Nowadays knowledge-based systems research and development essentially employs two paradigms of reasoning. There are on the one hand the logic-based approaches where logic is to be understood in a rather broad sense; usually these approaches are used in symbolic domains where numerical calculations are not the core challenge. On the other hand we find approximation oriented reasoning; methods of these kinds are mainly applied in numerical domains where approximation is part of the scientific methodology itself. However, from an abstract level all these approaches do focus on similar topics and arise on various levels such as problem modeling, inference and problem solving techniques, algorithms and mathematical methods, mathematical relations between discrete and continuous properties, and are integrated in tools and applications.

The particular behavior of trace metals in the environment is determined by their specific physico-chemical form rather than by their total concentration. The introduction of atomic absorption spectrometry has lead to a plethora of scientific papers and reports in which metal concentrations in the environment are only reported as total concentrations. Only recently has the need for improved knowledge on the various forms and bioavailability of metals been realised. Considerable research effort is now devoted to measuring the concentrations of trace metals in surface waters. Efforts are made to couple chemical analytical techniques to process-related biological problems. The proceedings of the workshop on The Speciation of Metals in Water, Sediment and Soil Systems held in Sunne, Sweden, comprise these efforts and show aspects for further cooperation between analytical chemists and biologists", "title_en": "Speciation of Metals in Water, Sediment and Soil Systems : Proceedings of an International Workshop, Sunne, October 15-16, 1986"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4007348-8", "gnd:4020820-5", "gnd:4038860-8", "gnd:4192392-3", "gnd:4054079-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Landner, Lars", "year": "1987", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

The Workshop on Nuclear Matter in Different Phases and Transitions, held March 31 - April 10, 1998, brought together both theorists and experimentalists working on the properties of nuclear and hadronic matter produced in heavy-ion collisions in various energy ranges. The main focus was on experimental signals revealing the possible phase changes of the matter, taking into account the finite size of the system, and the non- equilibrium features of the observed phenomena. A discussion of phase transitions in other small quantum systems, such as metallic clusters, or atomic Bose-Einstein condensates was also presented. The papers included in this volume present and review in an understandable and inspiring way the major experimental and theoretical advances in those different communities of physicists addressing similar physics questions, facing similar problems and often using analogous techniques.

Since the 1980s, software agents and multi-agent systems have grown into what is now one of the most active areas of research and development activity in computing generally. One of the most important reasons for the current intensity of interest in the agent-based computing paradigm certainly is that the concept of an agent as an autonomous system, capable of interacting with other agents in order to satisfy its design objectives, is a natural one for software designers. This recognition has led to the growth of interest in agents as a new paradigm for software engineering.

In the ten years since the scientific rationale for the design, synthesis and application of inorganic and organometallic polymers (IOPs) was first conceptualised, we have witnessed the first tentative exploration of IOPs as precursors to new materials, with efforts focusing on the design and synthesis of novel ceramic precursors. Developing expertise led to precursor studies combined with the characterisation of the transformation processes that occur when IOPs are converted to ceramic materials. Now at maturity, the science presented in this volume reveals the polymer precursor approach to materials synthesis together with examples of processing ceramic shapes for a range of mechanical properties, the development of sophisticated, noninvasive analytical techniques, and IOP design rationales relying on well-defined processing-property relationships. The production of multifunctional IOPs is described, providing ion conductivity, gas sensing, bioactivity, magnetic properties, etc., combined with processability. The existence of well-defined IOPs and the exquisite control that can be exerted on sol-gel systems now provide access to such a variety of mixed organic-organometallic and/or inorganic hybrid systems that their exploitation is likely to develop into an entirely new field of materials chemistry. Future exciting avenues of research are also being opened up with the advent of buckyballs, Met-Cars, dopable preceramics, rigid-rod organometallics, and molecular tinkertoys", "title_en": "Applications of Organometallic Chemistry in the Preparation and Processing of Advanced Materials"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4062670-2", "gnd:4142565-0", "gnd:4173025-2", "gnd:4169616-5", "gnd:4312250-4", "gnd:4297838-5", "gnd:4030282-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1221608134", "year": "1995", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This volume contains the proceedings of the conference \"state and Frequency Domain Approaches to Infinite-Dimensional Systems\". The aim was to bring together engineers and mathematicians working in the field of linear infinite-dimensional systems who are specialists in one or more of the following categories of mathematical approaches: semigroup approches,p.d.e. approaches, frequency domain approaches and syntheses of state-space and frequency domain approaches. Since these approaches use very different sophisticated mathematical techniques, it is unusual for a scientist to be expert in all of them. On the other hand, there different approaches all purport to address the same control problems for the same classes of linear infinite-dimensional systems. It is therefore important to compare and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these different mathematical techniques. To help ameliorate the communication gab a series of introductory tutorial lectures were given by specialists in the above-mentioned fields.

This book offers the first comprehensive account of the new method of density matrix renormalization. Recent years have seen enormous progress in the numerical treatment of low-dimensional quantum sytems. With this new technique, which selects a reduced set of basis states via density matrices, it has become possible to treat large systems with amazing accuracy. The method has been applied successfully to a variety of important one-dimensional problems such as spin chains, Kondo models, and correlated electron systems. Extensions to other systems and higher dimensions are currently being developed. The contributions to this book are written by leading experts in the field.

Although dissidence has been primarily associated with architectural practices in the Eastern Bloc at the end of the Cold War period, contemporary architecture has in recent years developed a host of new methodologies and techniques for articulating its distance from, and critique of, dominant political and financial structures. This book maps out and expands upon the methodologies of architectural action and reinvigorates the concept of dissent within the architectural field. It expands the notion of dissidence to other similar practices and strategies of resistance, in a variety of historical and geographical contexts. It discusses how the gestures and techniques of past struggles, as well as 'dilemmas' of working in politically suppressive regimes, can help to inform those of today. This collection of essays from expert scholars demonstrates the multiple responses to this subject, the potential and dangers of dissidence, and thus constructs a robust lexicon of concepts that will point to possible ways forward for politically and theoretically committed architects and practitioners\"--", "title_en": "Architecture and the paradox of dissidence"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4002851-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:10189637-2", "year": "2014", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This volume brings the focus back to the sensual aspects of architecture - the subtle and intangible way it impacts on human experience - through the work of six leading architects from around the world, all of whom have created a unique immersive installation for the Royal Academy. Conversations with each of these architects - including Kengo Kuma, Xiaodong and Pezo von Ellrichshausen - show the multiplicity of ways in which different approaches to the built environment can affect the way in which we connect with our surroundings, while an introduction by Philip Ursprung explores the background to this humanistic approach to design.

The influence of Bernhard Ruf, to whom this volume is dedicated on the occasion of his 60th birthday, is perceptible throughout the collection by the choice of themes and techniques. The many contributors consider modern topics in the calculus of variations, topological methods and regularity analysis, together with novel applications of partial differential equations. In keeping with the tradition of the workshop, emphasis is given to elliptic operators inserted in different contexts, both theoretical and applied. Topics include semi-linear and fully nonlinear equations and systems with different nonlinearities, at sub- and supercritical exponents, with spectral interactions of Ambrosetti-Prodi type. Also treated are analytic aspects as well as applications such as diffusion problems in mathematical genetics and finance and evolution equations related to electromechanical devices.--", "title_en": "Analysis and topology in nonlinear differential equations : a tribute to Bernhard Ruf on the occasion of his 60th birthday"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4013396-5", "gnd:4044779-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2014", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Avant-Gardes (Open Form #2), June 7 - July 21, 2007, at Künstlerhaus Stuttgart]. Oskar Hansens (19222005) theoretical concept of open form was developed in the context of international debates around late-modern architecture in the 1950s. Open form assumed that no artistic expression is complete until it has been appropriated by its users or beholders. In the following decades, the concept became a key principle of performance and film art, and led to the development of process-oriented and interdisciplinary artistic techniques. Hansens concept revolutionized the traditional means of artistic communication.0This publication examines the impact of Hansens ideas within contemporary visual culture and the redefined role of the viewer since the 1960s. The book includes in-depth interviews with some of the most important protagonists of experimental art in Poland, who investigate the historical impact of the open form. Other contributions comment on the theorys influence on a younger generation of artists.

Residues originate in rural and in urban systems. Many contain biogenic ingredients, e.g. food and green waste, livestock manure, feces, sewage and other sludge’s, harvest residues, digestates, agro-industry residues, and more. Commonly residues are known to pollute environments, causes hygienic problems or they are cost-intensive to collect and treat. Since fossil raw materials are becoming scarce, biogenic residues are more and more a topic of utilization. Application options are manifold. They range from energetic utilization, e.g. to provide electricity and heat for households, industries and agricultural facilities, up to substantial applications ranging from bulk products such as composts and specific products like mineral fertilizers or biochemicals. A special challenge is the interface between rural and urban systems. In this context the mutual understanding is often limited, usually due to a lack of knowledge or contradicting interests. The RAMIRAN2015 proceedings provides reviewed four-page summaries of about 160 conference presentations given by participants from more than 35 countries to the described issues at the conference. The information relates on the state-of-the-art and on innovations in following areas: quality fertilizers from residues, sustainable soils, advances in emission prevention, the bioresource challenge, and sustainable regions. Rückstände stammen aus ländlichen und aus städtischen Systemen. Viele enthalten biogene Bestandteile, z.B. Nahrungs- und Gartenabfälle, Rückstände aus Nutztierhaltungen, Abwasser und andere Schlämme, Ernterückstände, Gärreste, Agro-Industrie Rückstände und mehr. Allgemein ist bekannt, dass diese Rückstände die Umwelt verunreinigen und hygienische Probleme hervorrufen können und dass ihre Einsammlung und Behandlung kostenintensiv ist. Seitdem fossile Rohstoffe knapper werden, sind biogene Rückstände und deren Nutzung mehr und mehr ein Thema. Die Verwendungsmöglichkeiten sind vielfältig. Sie reichen von der Energienutzung, z. B. um Strom und Wärme für Haushalte, Industrien und landwirtschaftliche Anlagen zu liefern, bis hin zu den substanziellen Verwertungen. Beispiele sind Bulk-Produkte wie Kompost oder höherwertige Produkte wie Mineraldünger oder Biochemikalien. Eine spezielle Herausforderung ist die Schnittstelle zwischen ländlichen und städtischen Systemen. In diesem Zusammenhang ist das gegenseitige Einvernehmen häufig begrenzt, normalerweise aus Mangel an Wissen oder Interesse an der Durchsetzung. Das Artikel-Buch RAMIRAN2015 stellt vierseitige begutachtete Ausarbeitungen von ungefähr 160 Konferenzbeiträgen zur Verfügung, die von den Teilnehmern aus mehr als 35 Ländern zu den beschriebenen Themen erstellt wurden.

In the last decades quantum mechanics has given rise to a new quantum technological era, a revolution taking place today especially within the field of quantum information processing; which goes from quantum teleportation and cryptography to quantum computation. Quantum theory is probably our best confirmed physical theory. However, in spite of its great empirical effectiveness it stands today still without a universally accepted physical representation that allows us to understand its relation to the world and reality. The novelty of the book comes from the multiple perspectives put forward by top researchers in quantum mechanics, from Europe as well as North and South America, discussing the meaning and structure of the theory of quanta. The book comprises in a balanced manner physical, philosophical, logical and mathematical approaches to quantum mechanics and quantum information. Going from quantum superpositions and entanglement to dynamics and the problem of identity; from quantum logic, computation and quasi-set theory to the category approach and teleportation; from realism and empiricism to operationalism and instrumentalism; the book considers from different angles some of the most intriguing questions in the field.

This volume focuses on recent developments in the understanding and energy and material processing applications of liquid salts. Due to their great range of working temperatures, liquid salts -- including oxide melts, ionic liquids, and deep eutectic solvents -- can offer significant benefits for improving energy efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the production of many materials and processing technologies. A great many opportunities remain for these species, particularly for thermal, electrochemical and nuclear energy vectors. Even fossil energy, and the related CO₂ capture, conversion and utilisation can be accommodated efficiently in liquid salt-based processes and devices. Technological advancement in these areas relies heavily on a sound understanding of the underlying science of the large number of liquid salts and their widely varying properties. This volume discusses and debates the state of the art in liquid salts, highlighting recent developments in our understanding of their fundamental properties and how their application can help in addressing some of the most important current global challenges", "title_en": "Liquid salts for energy and materials : The University of Nottingham, Ningbo, China, 11-13 May 2016"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4151764-7", "gnd:7548899-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1112568697; gnd:1081649-5", "year": "2016", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This volume brings together the work of researchers from both the chemical sciences and energy and process engineering communities in the field of carbon capture and storage. The global generation of power depends heavily on coal-fired power plants; in 2008 nearly half of electricity was generated via coal combustion. This is expected to drop as a percentage but rise in absolute terms by 2035. Moreover, industrial processes such as the production of cement or iron emit CO2 as an intrinsic part of the process. As fossil fuels will remain part of the global energy mix for some time, carbon capture and storage is a \"must develop\" technology for reducing carbon emissions. Carbon capture and storage is currently being tested at the megawatt scale, and chemists and chemical engineers are working together to incorporate new technologies into viable processes. Recent advances in modelling can be used to produce large-scale models of power plants and capture equipment. Meanwhile, developments in the use of CO2 as a platform chemical are leading to new questions, such as whether CO2 capture and storage and CO2 utilisation are competitors, and what factors could influence the choice of one over the other", "title_en": "Carbon capture and storage : Sheffield, United Kingdom, 18-20 July 2016"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4164507-8", "gnd:7628985-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1081649-5; gnd:1119084962", "year": "2016", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

His influence as a designer not only spread fast globally, but also played a leading part in the transformation of material culture from the mid-nineteenth century onwards. Pugin?s work has been comprehensively reevaluated over the last decade. In this volume sixteen leading scholars from across the globe discuss Pugin?s direct influence on church architecture and furnishing. Beautifully illustrated with a large selection of new photography, \"Gothic Revival Worldwide\", the successor to the volume Gothic Revival published in 2000, reveals how Pugin?s ideas played a profound role in the changing face of material reform in church architecture as an expression of the evolving identity of the churches across the world from North America to Mongolia and the South Pacific", "title_en": "Gothic revival worldwide : A.W.N.

Interdisciplinary study on the role of earthquakes in the eastern Mediterranean. Does the \"Minoan myth\" still stand up to scientific scrutiny? Since the work of Sir Arthur Evans at Knossos (Crete, Greece), the romanticized vision of the Cretan Bronze Age as an era of peaceful prosperity only interrupted by the catastrophic effects of natural disasters has captured the popular and scientific imagination.

Autonomous Systems are a hot topic. Their development is being driven by advances in networking, sensor technology and machine learning. Countries like the USA, Korea, Japan, China and Germany, are taking the lead. Technology develops internationally but the law is shaped and made at a national level. Tension between the two disciplines are almost inevitable, especially since technology is advancing at such a fast pace.The research papers collected in this volume focus on fundamental questions of how the law should deal not only with new technologies in general, but also with some special issues, such as autonomous vehicles and drones. These texts were generated by the AUTONOMICS for Industry 4.0 technology program of the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology.With contributions by:Prof. Dr. Dr. Eric Hilgendorf; Uwe Seidel; Prof. Dr. Amedeo Santosuosso; Prof. Dr. Ryan Calo; Xiaoyan Huang; Minkyu Kim; Takayuki Matsuo, Prof. Dr. Kristen Thomasen; Prof. Dr. Susanne Beck; Berthold Haustein, Jochen Feldle Autonome Systeme sind ein Trendthema. Durch zunehmende Vernetzung, Sensorik und Maschinenlernen wird ihre Entwicklung stetig vorangetrieben. Länder wie die USA, Korea, Japan, China, aber auch Deutschland nehmen dabei eine Vorreiterrolle ein. Der internationalen Technikentwicklung steht die nationale Konzeption und Entwicklung des Rechts gegenüber. Spannungen zwischen den beiden Disziplinen lassen sich - insbesondere bei der Geschwindigkeit der technischen Entwicklung - kaum vermeiden. Die hier vorgelegten Untersuchungen behandeln grundlegende Fragen des rechtlichen Umgangs mit den neuen technischen Entwicklungen, aber auch Spezialfälle wie Autonome Fahrzeuge oder Drohnen. Hervorgegangen sind die Texte aus dem Technologieprogramm AUTONOMIK für Industrie 4.0 des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Energie.

This book contains the refereed proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Agile Software Development, XP 2016, held in Edinburgh, UK, in May 2016.While agile development has already become mainstream in industry, this field is still constantly evolving and continues to spur an enormous interest both in industry and academia. To this end, the XP conference attracts a large number of software practitioners and researchers, providing a rare opportunity for interaction between the two communities.The 14 full papers accepted for XP 2016 were selected from 42 submissions. Additionally, 11 experience reports (from 25 submissions) 5 empirical studies (out of 12 submitted) and 5 doctoral papers (from 6 papers submitted) were selected, and in each case the authors were shepherded by an experienced researcher. Generally, all of the submitted papers went through a rigorous peer-review process", "title_en": "Agile Processes, in Software Engineering, and Extreme Programming: 17th International Conference, XP 2016, Edinburgh, UK, May 24-27, 2016, Proceedings"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4618499-5", "gnd:4806620-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Sharp, Helen; Hall, Tracy", "year": "2016", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}
