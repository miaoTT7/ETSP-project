The aim of the paper is to define design recommendations for gender- and diversity-sensitive social media appearances to strengthen participation in the context of local public transport and mobility planning. Social media are an effective instrument for actively and sustainably involving citizens and other interest groups in planning and evaluation processes [1]. A major advantage is its reach across gender, cultural, language and national boundaries, which means that a high diversity of users can be covered. For this very reason, social media have become one of the most important tools when it comes to implementing and promoting participation culture effectively and efficiently. Social media can not only be used to inform interested parties, but also to actively and above all interactively involve them. In order for this to happen, the needs and requirements of users must be taken into account when designing social media appearances. In addition to flexible user interface design and content design, this includes enabling and providing elements for an interactive exchange of information, opinions and experiences between providers and users as well as among users. Although this type of participation is already widespread (e.g. as marketing for companies and products, but also for political opinion-forming), it has not yet fully entered all areas. Especially in the transport sector, the social media appearances provide information, but often these are not designed to be gender- and diversity-transcending and therefore not understandable and usable for all target groups.

Traffic-related emissions are strongly criticised by the public because they con-tribute to climate change and are classified as hazardous to health. Combustion engine emissions have been regulated by limit values for almost three decades. There is currently no legal limit for non-exhaust emissions, which include par-ticulate brake and tire wear and resuspension. As a result, the percentage of total vehicle emissions has risen continuously. Since some of the particles can be as-signed to the size classes of particulate matter (≤ 10 µm), these sources of par-ticulate matter are of particular relevance to human health. To predict the amount of particles emitted as a function of the driving situation or driving condition, a comprehensive database must be prepared and transferred to a prediction model. This makes it possible to simulate environmental pollution in multivalent traffic scenarios. At present, no approaches have been described in the literature by whose application the emission indicators can be effectively pre-dicted. Furthermore, the mechanisms of brake and tire particle formation are as-sociated with highly stochastic phenomena that cannot be captured by traditional deterministic modelling tools. Therefore, machine learning algorithms are used in the present work to identify branched correlations between tribological properties, pad composition and operating conditions. Different experimental methods are presented to determine brake and tire particle emission models.

For abstract games, an equilibrium is defined as an assignment to each player of a strategy that is best for him when the others use the strategies assigned to them. The relevance of this abstract mutual consistency requirement for economic modeling is an open question. The requirement has two related problems: disequilibrium and coordination failure. First, the mutual consistency requirement of an equilibrium assignment is not an implication of individual rationality, but an additional strong assumption.

In particular, the sellers were allowed to come together to a corner of one of the rooms and confer after the close of one trading period and before the start of another.

Price increases due to price signaling are more likely when sellers compete in multiple markets. Conspiracies are more successful when a subset of sellers forego short term gains by repeatedly offering supercompetitive prices. The market impact of price signaling depends on the signaling language available to sellers. Very restrictive language (e.g., one price proposal by one seller per period) does not have a lasting impact on prices.

Many aspects of antitrust policy are influenced by the possibility that sellers in concentrated markets may have the power to raise prices above competitive levels. Of course, anyone can raise prices, so the issue is whether a change in structure, e.g., a merger, will allow one or more sellers to raise price profitably. A price increase by one seller diverts sales to others, so a firm is more likely to have market power when its competitors have limited capacity to expand their sales. Thus a merger that reduces competitors' capacity may create market power. Market power can also be sensitive to the trading institution, and this is the context that power issues first arose in experimental economics.

But macroeconomic data are revised, often significantly, as time passes and new source data become available and conceptual changes are made. How is forecasting influenced by the fact that data are revised? To answer this question, we begin with the example of the index of leading economic indicators to illustrate the real-time data issues. Then we look at the data that have been developed for U.S. data revisions, called the “Real-Time Data Set for Macroeconomists” and show their basic features, illustrating the magnitude of the revisions and thus motivating their potential influence on forecasts and on forecasting models. The data set consists of a set of data vintages, where a data vintage refers to a date at which someone observes a time series of data; so the data vintage September 1974 refers to all the macroeconomic time series available to someone in September 1974. Next, we examine experiments using that data set by Stark and Croushore (2002), Journal of Macroeconomics 24, 507–531, to illustrate how the data revisions could have affected reasonable univariate forecasts. In doing so, we tackle the issues of what variables are used as “actuals” in evaluating forecasts and we examine the techniques of repeated observation forecasting, illustrate the differences in U.S. data of forecasting with real-time data as opposed to latest-available data, and examine the sensitivity to data revisions of model selection governed by various information criteria. Third, we look at the economic literature on the extent to which data revisions affect forecasts, including discussions of how forecasts differ when using first-available compared with latest-available data, whether these effects are bigger or smaller depending on whether a variable is being forecast in levels or growth rates, how much influence data revisions have on model selection and specification, and evidence on the predictive content of variables when subject to revision. Given that data are subject to revision and that data revisions influence forecasts, what should forecasters do?

Using taxonomies of all sources of forecast errors for both conditional mean and conditional variance processes, we consider the impacts of breaks and their relevance in forecasting models: (a) where the breaks occur after forecasts are announced; and (b) where they occur in-sample and hence pre-forecasting. The impact on forecasts depends on which features of the models are non-constant. Different models and methods are shown to fare differently in the face of breaks. While structural breaks induce an instability in some parameters of a particular model, the consequences for forecasting are specific to the type of break and form of model. We present a detailed analysis for cointegrated VARs, given the popularity of such models in econometrics. We also consider the detection of breaks, and how to handle breaks in a forecasting context, including ad hoc forecasting devices and the choice of the estimation period.

This chapter examines the problems of dealing with trending type data when there is uncertainty over whether or not we really have unit roots in the data. This uncertainty is practical – for many macroeconomic and financial variables theory does not imply a unit root in the data however unit root tests fail to reject. This means that there may be a unit root or roots close to the unit circle. We first examine the differences between results using stationary predictors and nonstationary or near nonstationary predictors. Unconditionally, the contribution of parameter estimation error to expected loss is of the same order for stationary and nonstationary variables despite the faster convergence of the parameter estimates. However expected losses depend on true parameter values. We then review univariate and multivariate forecasting in a framework where there is uncertainty over the trend. In univariate models we examine trade-offs between estimators in the short and long run. Estimation of parameters for most models dominates imposing a unit root. It is for these models that the effects of nuisance parameters in the models is clearest. For multivariate models we examine forecasting from cointegrating models as well as examine the effects of erroneously assuming cointegration. It is shown that inconclusive theoretical implications arise from the dependence of forecast performance on nuisance parameters. Depending on these nuisance parameters imposing cointegration can be more or less useful for different horizons.

This chapter explores how economists use experimental methods to understand better the behavioral underpinnings of environmental valuation. Economic experiments, in the lab or field, are an attractive tool to address intricate incentive and contextual questions that arise in assessing values through direct statements of preferences. By combining empirical observation with theoretical insight, researchers use the experimental method and mindset to help explain how economic and social contexts matter to valuation. Herein we consider three themes in applying the experimental method to valuation rational choice theory and stated values, direct value elicitation in the field and lab, and testbedding survey designs prior to field application. First, experimental tests of rational valuation are discussed. This lab work examines whether respondents make choices and state values in a manner consistent with standard rational choice theory. The circumstances of rational valuation are illustrated by the malleability of two classic anomalies the WTPWTA divergence and the preference reversal phenomenon. Second, direct experimental methods to measure actual values for public and private goods are examined. These experiments ask people to buy and sell actual goods to elicit real values, in which researchers test how alternative exchange institutions affect these values. Third, we survey testbed experiments designed to identify potential incentive problems caused by hypothetical valuation questions.

Work on contingent valuation now typically comprises the largest single group of papers at major environmental economics conferences and in several of the leading journals in the field.

This chapter explores the theory and practice of measuring the economic costs and benefits of environmental changes that influence production, both in the context of firms and of households. The theory uses models of household and firm decision making to map the influence of environmental changes to changes in human welfare. The goal is to measure, by compensating or equivalent changes in incomes, the welfare effects on people, in their roles as owners of firms, owners of factors of production, and consumers. The developing country context is most common for valuing the environment as an input, because agriculture and natural resource extraction are so much more important than in industrialized countries. When households or firms produce goods for sale on the market, and the environment influences the costs of production, we show the circumstances when one can use information embodied in the supply curve of the marketed good or the demand curve for an input into the production of the good to extract welfare measures for environmental change. When the environment affects the cost of production of goods households produce and consume, we show the restrictions on production technology that will permit welfare measure for changes in the environment. We also look at circumstances that permit the calculations of bounds for the exact welfare measures. We explore welfare measurement under a variety of institutional structures, including government support for agricultural commodities and open-access fisheries. Exact welfare measurement makes extensive demands for data. Because these demands are not often met in practice, researchers resort to a variety of approximations of welfare measures.

Public policies that lead to a reduction in the emissions of air and water pollutants or the protection of sensitive ecosystems presumably increase the well-being of many members of society. Applied welfare economists are accustomed to measuring the welfare effects of policies that invoke price changes. If it is granted that the public good attributes of most dimensions of environmental quality preclude the development of well functioning markets for these service flows, how are the monetary values of changes in environmental quality to be measured? The past twenty to thirty years have seen the rapid development of the economic theory and techniques for measuring the demands for nonmarketed goods, and in this chapter we attempt to sketch out the major results. We review the basic concept of economic welfare and derive measures of welfare change for both changes in prices of market goods and changes in quantities and qualities of nonmarket goods. We then describe the principal economic techniques for estimating the benefits of environmental quality improvements when these improvements either directly affect individuals' well-being or indirectly affect individuals through constraints they face. Perhaps the major class of measurement methods is based on the observation that changes in environmental quality may cause individuals to alter purchases of goods and services that are complements or substitutes for environmental quality in their preference orderings. These revealed preference methods are the primary focus of this chapter.

Financial markets display a host of universal “stylized facts” begging for a scientific explanation: Excess volatility, fat tails, and clustered activity are well known and have been studied for many years. More microstructural stylized facts have recently emerged, for example the long memory of the order flow or the square-root dependence of impact on the volume of metaorders. Agent-based models are attempts to account for these stylized facts in a unified manner. Devising faithful microstructural ABMs would allow one to answer crucial questions, such as those related to market stability. Can large orders destabilize markets? Is HFT activity detrimental? Can destabilizing feedback loops be mitigated by adequate regulation? The present review paper summarizes recent work in that direction. We discuss in particular the Santa-Fe zero-intelligence model, which provides a very interesting benchmark, but suffers from important drawbacks as well, such as strong mean-reversion effects. One can enrich the Santa-Fe model as to reproduce both diffusive prices, and the square-root impact law. The underlying mechanism can be well understood in terms of a generic “reaction–diffusion” model for the dynamics of the liquidity, which can be solved analytically. Finally, we argue that the role of “information” is probably overstated in classical theories, while a picture based on a self-reflexive price-impacting order flow has many merits.

Standard neoclassical economics asks what agents' actions, strategies, or expectations are in equilibrium with (consistent with) the outcome or pattern these behaviors aggregatively create. Agent-based computational economics enables us to ask a wider question: how agents' actions, strategies, or expectations might react to—might endogenously change with—the patterns they create. In other words, it enables us to examine how the economy behaves out of equilibrium, when it is not at a steady state. This out-of-equilibrium approach is not a minor adjunct to standard economic theory; it is economics done in a more general way. When examined out of equilibrium, economic patterns sometimes simplify into a simple, homogeneous equilibrium of standard economics; but just as often they show perpetually novel and complex behavior. The static equilibrium approach suffers two characteristic indeterminacies: it cannot easily resolve among multiple equilibria; nor can it easily model individuals' choices of expectations. Both problems are ones of formation (of an equilibrium and of an “ecology” of expectations, respectively), and when analyzed in formation—that is, out of equilibrium—these anomalies disappear.", "title_en": "Chapter 32 Out-of-Equilibrium Economics and Agent-Based Modeling"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4148259-1", "gnd:4011152-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Arthur, W.

An agent-based model is a virtual world comprising distributed heterogeneous agents who interact over time. In a spatial agent-based model the agents are situated in a spatial environment and are typically assumed to be able to move in various ways across this environment. Some kinds of social or organizational systems may also be modeled as spatial environments, where agents move from one group or department to another and where communications or mobility among groups may be structured according to implicit or explicit channels or transactions costs. This chapter focuses on the potential usefulness of computational laboratories for spatial agent-based modeling. Speaking broadly, a computational laboratory is any computational framework permitting the exploration of the behaviors of complex systems through systematic and replicable simulation experiments. By that definition, most of the research discussed in this handbook would be considered to be work with computational laboratories. A narrower definition of computational laboratory (or comp lab for short) refers specifically to specialized software tools to support the full range of agent-based modeling and complementary tasks. These tasks include model development, model evaluation through controlled experimentation, and both the descriptive and normative analysis of model outcomes. The objective of this chapter is to explore how comp lab tools and activities facilitate the systematic exploration of spatial agent-based models embodying complex social processes critical for social welfare.

Computer automation has the potential, just starting to be realized, of transforming the design and operation of markets, and the behaviors of agents trading in them. We discuss the possibilities for automating markets, presenting a broad conceptual framework covering resource allocation as well as enabling marketplace services such as search and transaction execution. One of the most intriguing opportunities is provided by markets implementing computationally sophisticated negotiation mechanisms, for example combinatorial auctions. An important theme that emerges from the literature is the centrality of design decisions about matching the domain of goods over which a mechanism operates to the domain over which agents have preferences. When the match is imperfect (as is almost inevitable), the market game induced by the mechanism is analytically intractable, and the literature provides an incomplete characterization of rational bidding policies. A review of the literature suggests that much of our existing knowledge comes from computational simulations, including controlled studies of abstract market designs (e.g., simultaneous ascending auctions), and research tournaments comparing agent strategies in a variety of market scenarios.

Regularization and dimension reduction methods are then discussed. Irrespective of the model size, there is an unavoidable tension between prediction accuracy and consistent model determination.

The popular scholarly exercise of evaluating exchange rate forecasting models relative to a random walk was stimulated by the well-cited Meese and Rogoff (1983) paper. Practitioners who construct quantitative models for trading exchange rates approach forecasting from a different perspective. Rather than focus on forecast errors for bilateral exchange rates, as in the Meese–Rogoff case, we present what is required for constructing a successful trading model. To provide more perspective, a particular approach to quantitative modeling is presented that incorporates return forecasts, a risk model, and a transaction cost constraint in an optimization framework. Since beating a random walk is not a useful evaluation metric for currency investing, we discuss the use of benchmarks and conclude that performance evaluation in currencies is much more problematic than in equity markets due to the lack of a passive investment strategy and the multitude of alternative formulations of well-known currency style factors. We then provide analytical tools that can be useful in evaluating currency manager skill in terms of portfolio tilts and timing. Finally, we examine how conditioning information can be employed to enhance timing skill in trading generic styles like the carry trade. Such information can be valuable in reducing the duration and magnitude of portfolio drawdowns.", "title_en": "Chapter 13.

The list includes country-specific tax, spending, social security, healthcare policy, deficit policy age-cohort- and country-specific mortality, age-specific fertility, age-specific morbidity, lifespan uncertainty, age- and skill-specific emigration and immigration, earnings inequality driven by skill differences and idiosyncratic labor earnings uncertainty, capital adjustment costs, international trade, international capital flows, trade specialization, and trade policy. The chapter begins with the benchmark dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) simulation model of Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), discusses various advances in OLG simulation modeling and then presents two applications. The first is a closed-economy model, calibrated for Germany, that features idiosyncratic labor earnings uncertainty and changes in demographics. After running the model through a number of policy simulations, we turn to an open-economy model, featuring five regions (the US, Europe, Japan and other Asian countries, China, and India) producing six goods, some of which are traded. We use this model to quantify how economies will transition over time, how wage inequality will evolve, how tax rates will change in light of societal aging and how various unilateral and multilateral policy reforms impact the six regions.", "title_en": "Chapter 27.

This chapter aims to provide a hands-on approach to New Keynesian models and their uses for macroeconomic policy analysis. It starts by reviewing the origins of the New Keynesian approach, the key model ingredients and representative models. Building blocks of current-generation dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models are discussed in detail. These models address the famous Lucas critique by deriving behavioral equations systematically from the optimizing and forward-looking decision making of households and firms subject to well-defined constraints. State-of-the-art methods for solving and estimating such models are reviewed and presented in examples. The chapter goes beyond the mere presentation of the most popular benchmark model by providing a framework for model comparison along with a database that includes a wide variety of macroeconomic models. Thus, it offers a convenient approach for comparing new models to available benchmarks and for investigating whether particular policy recommendations are robust to model uncertainty. Such robustness analysis is illustrated by evaluating the performance of simple monetary policy rules across a range of recently estimated models, including some with financial market imperfections, and by reviewing recent comparative findings regarding the magnitude of government spending multipliers.

Studying the poverty and income distribution effects of macroeconomic policies or shocks requires a methodology that accounts on the one hand for the nature of the policy or shock being studied and their aggregate impact on the economy and, on the other hand, the heterogeneity of their overall effects among individuals or households at the micro level. Standard evaluation methods are of little use here. Methods based on the comparison between individuals exposed and not exposed to the policy or shock are clearly not applicable since, by definition, all individuals are affected by any policy with some macroeconomic dimension. The evaluation methodology thus needs to rely not only on a micro but also on a macro counterfactual within some kind of general equilibrium setting. This chapter reviews the growing literature that addresses this challenge by combining macro and micro modeling in various ways. It describes existing methodologies and their underpinning links with economic theory and presents some applications. The chapter is structured according to the nature of the computable general equilibrium (CGE) macro model being used and how the macro and micro components of the methodology are connected together and/or integrated. It thus starts from a simple framework where the two components are handled separately: the CGE model is static and Walrasian and the unidirectional link from the macro to the micro component essentially consists of changes in prices. It then moves to more integrated variants, where results from both the CGE and micro models are looped back and forth, and also to non-Walrasian specifications where both price and aggregate quantity changes link the macro and the micro components. Finally the chapter considers dynamic settings where the static CGE model on the macro side is replaced by a recursive-dynamic model, whereas the micro data base is allowed to change over time through both exogenous demographic and policy-induced endogenous economic transitions.

We review the literature estimating trade elasticities, focusing on several key considerations. What are the identifying assumptions used to separate supply and demand parameters? What is the nature of the shock to prices employed in the econometrics? And what is the time horizon over which trade responds to this shock? This discussion ranges from older reduced form approaches that use time-series variation in prices, to more recent work that identifies demand elasticities from trade costs or by using instruments in cross-section or panel data, and finally to prominent applications that separately identify supply and demand parameters in the absence of instruments. We also discuss recent theoretical developments from the literature on heterogeneous firms that complicate the interpretation of all these parameter estimates. Finally, we briefly survey a literature on structural estimation and link this to recent attempts to incorporate such theories in CGE applications.

A key distinguishing characteristic of computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling in Australia is its orientation to providing inputs to the policy-formation process. Policy makers require detail. They want to be able to identify convincingly which industries, which occupations, which regions and which households would benefit or lose from policy changes, and when the benefits or losses might be expected to flow. In this chapter, we explain how the necessary level of detail can be provided, using as an example analysis that was undertaken by Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) and Frontier Economics of the potential economic impacts of a carbon price on the Australian economy. The Australian carbon price framework is assumed to be part of a global emissions trading scheme (ETS). Over time, the global ETS becomes the dominant greenhouse abatement policy for all countries including Australia. It sets the price for carbon permits and allocates the number of permits available to each country. A number of key findings emerge from the CGE simulations of the effects of the ETS policy. (i) Domestic abatement falls well short of targeted abatement, requiring significant amounts of permits to be imported. (ii) Despite the requirement for deep cuts in emissions, the ETS reduces Australias GDP by only about 1.1% relative to the base case in 2030. The negative impact on real household consumption (the preferred measure of national welfare) is somewhat greater, reflecting the need to import permits. (iii) The national macroeconomic impacts of the ETS might be described as modest in the context of the policy task. However, this does not carry through to the industry and state/territory levels where some industries and regions prove particularly vulnerable in terms of potential lost employment. The need for detail is highlighted throughout the analysis. For example, a suitably detailed treatment of electricity supply is provided by linking CoPS CGE model with Frontiers detailed bottom-up model of the stationary energy sector. Similarly, necessary detail on the effects of the global ETS on Australias international trading conditions is provided by linking with a multicountry model.", "title_en": "Chapter 9.

Over the past three decades the field of regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling has flourished, growing from a handful of top-down, single-region and low-dimensioned multiregional models, to a mature field, in which output of large-scale general-purpose multiregional CGE models has become a standard input to policy deliberations in a growing number of countries. Researchers have ensured that innovations in theory, data construction and model application have matched growth in both computing power and the appetite of government decision makers for expanding levels of policy-relevant regional and sectoral detail. This chapter focuses on the development of the field, its current state, and its accomplishments in elucidating important research questions and policy issues in regional economics. We begin by discussing the development of regional CGE modeling as a subdiscipline of CGE modeling, expanding on the distinguishing attributes of regional CGE models. We then discuss policy applications of regional CGE models, demonstrating the power of such models to answer important policy questions and providing an application-driven motivation for our discussion of the innovations in the field. We consider the key theoretical features of multiregional CGE models, identifying the many ways researchers have modeled the behavior of economic agents in a multiregional context.

We argue that this focus is limited in that shocks to health itself, rather than consumption, may be more damaging. Since human capital is not transferrable, health risk—unlike medical spending risk—cannot be pooled through traditional insurance. Instead, medical innovation is the main method of achieving smoothing in health across disease states. We explore the welfare implications of this “health insurance” view of medical R&amp;D . We also review the evidence on how FDA regulations affect overall health risk, as regulations lower health risks of products ex post but raise risk ex ante by discouraging medical innovation.

This chapter surveys the recent literature on output forecasting, and examines the real-time forecasting ability of several models for U.S. output growth. In particular, it evaluates the accuracy of short-term forecasts of linear and nonlinear structural and reduced-form models, and judgmental forecasts of output growth. Our emphasis is on using solely the information that was available at the time the forecast was being made, in order to reproduce the forecasting problem facing forecasters in real-time. We find that there is a large difference in forecast performance across business cycle phases. In particular, it is much harder to forecast output growth during recessions than during expansions. Simple linear and nonlinear autoregressive models have the best accuracy in forecasting output growth during expansions, although the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model and the vector autoregressive model with financial variables do relatively well. On the other hand, we find that most models do poorly in forecasting output growth during recessions. The autoregressive model based on the nonlinear dynamic factor model that takes into account asymmetries between expansions and recessions displays the best real time forecast accuracy during recessions. Even though the Blue Chip forecasts are comparable, the dynamic factor Markov switching model has better accuracy, particularly with respect to the timing and depth of output fall during recessions in real time. The results suggest that there are large gains in considering separate forecasting models for normal times and models especially designed for periods of abrupt changes, such as during recessions and financial crises.", "title_en": "Chapter 3.

This article argues that the expansion of existing and the introduction of new guarantees for financial institutions has been a key element of the policy response to the recent financial crisis. Essentially, the government expanded its role as the provider of the safety net for banks by adopting the function of a guarantor of last resort. Among the various policy response measures, the expansion of guarantees has the benefit of entailing lower upfront fiscal costs relative to other options. Guarantees are not without cost however. Even if they do not generate significant upfront fiscal costs, they create contingent fiscal liabilities. Other potential costs include those arising from distortions to competition and incentives (moral hazard). For example, there may be a perception that similar guarantees will always be made available at low costs. The fact that the expansion of guarantees has not been as closely co-ordinated across borders as might have been desired has resulted in additional costs.

This article synthesises a selected literature on human capital formation and foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries. The aim is to take a bird’s eye view of the complex linkages between the activities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) and policies of host developing countries. In doing so, general trends, best practices and policy experiences are extracted to evaluate the current state of knowledge. The literature indicates that a high level of human capital is no doubt one of the key ingredients for attracting FDI, as well as for host countries to gain maximum benefits from their activities. Most developing countries, however, underinvest in human capital, and the investment that is actually taking place is unevenly distributed across countries and regions that have adopted different human resource development (HRD) policies. To improve human capital formation and thus to attract more FDI would therefore require a more coherent approach that takes host country constraints such as limited budgetary resources into account. One such approach is to provide strong incentives for MNEs and Investment Promotion Agencies (IPAs) to participate in formal education and vocational training even for workers employed by domestic firms. This allows HRD to be flexible and demanddriven. Another policy option is to facilitate human resource development (HRD) for small and medium-sized domestic enterprises which usually do not invest sufficiently in training of employees although these enterprises stand to gain most from education and training. In addition, FDI promotion policies can target high value-added MNEs that are more likely to bring new skills and knowledge to the economy that can be tapped by domestic enterprises. Lastly, it is important that key components of HRD policies, i.e. formal schooling and vocational education and training policies (post-formal schooling), are well coordinated so as to equip students with knowledge and skills that will later be complementary to training opportunities provided in the labour market.", "title_en": "Human capital formation and foreign direct : Investment in developing countries"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4113450-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Miyamoto, Koji", "year": "2008", "type": "Article", "language_original": "en"}}

OECD governments are facing ongoing, unprecedented challenges in raising smoothly large volumes of funds at lowest possible cost, while balancing refinancing-, repricing- and interest rate risks. Amidst continued uncertainty about the pace of recovery as well as the timing and sequencing of the steps of the exit strategy, gross borrowing needs of OECD governments are expected to reach almost USD 16 trillion in 2009, up from an earlier estimate of around USD 12 trillion. The tentative outlook for 2010 shows a stabilising borrowing picture at around the level of USD 16 trillion. A looming additional challenge is the risk that when the recovery gains traction, yields will start to rise.

Many financial innovations have had this effect. But others have not.

Considerations of problems aside, innovation should be seen as a natural aspect of the workings of a competitive system. Thus, the ideal policy approach is to find an appropriate balance between preserving safety and soundness of the system and allowing financial institutions and markets to perform their intended functions.

In 2010 authorities have taken the first steps to end some of the public support measures put in place in response to the financial crisis, starting with government guarantees for bond issues. Financial institutions have made extensive use of this tool, which has been effective in avoiding a further tightening of funding conditions, but this type of public support has, nonetheless, raised some concerns. First, the cost of issuing guaranteed bonds has mainly reflected the characteristics of the sovereign guarantor rather than those of the issuer, thus favouring “weak” borrowers with a “strong” sovereign backing. This situation has the potential to distort competition and create incentives for excessive risk taking. Such effects could have been reduced by the choice of a different fee determination mechanism.

Zambia has a huge agricultural potential, which is still largely untapped, and could play a key role in growth and poverty eradication. Since the early 2000s, the government has implemented important reforms to promote privatisation and trade reforms, leading to higher investment and a strong growth in export crops such as cotton and horticulture. Despite this success, agricultural productivity, especially for food crops, remains low. The study shows that public resources to the agricultural sector have drastically decreased since the early 1990s, while private sector providers have not stepped in to fill the void left by the government disengagement from input supply and marketing. Despite a strong government commitment to reverse this trend, budget figures show that the share in total allocations dropped again in the 2008 budget. The study also argues that evaluations of past donor interventions in agriculture are not very positive, especially in terms of their sustainability. Projects often paid little attention to local absorptive and implementing capacity, had too narrow a focus on production and food security, and lacked an adequate understanding of the socio-economic conditions and behaviour of the target groups. Lack of co-ordination resulted in duplications and insufficient scale. A new generation of donor projects emerged in the early 2000s, with a strong focus on commercialisation and the development of market linkages, especially via contract farming. These projects have borne good results in terms of production volumes, quality standards and access to international commodity chains, as well as farmers’ income. The key challenge for donors is to scale up these success cases and ensure sustainability. The implementation of the Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia 2007-2010 is an opportunity to achieve a better division of labour, strengthen synergies on the ground and reduce transaction costs for government.

Europe has been beset by an interrelated banking crisis and sovereign debt crisis. Bond spreads faced by Greece and Ireland, and to a lesser extent Portugal followed by Spain, have increased. This paper explores these issues from the perspective of financial markets, focusing mainly on the four countries in the frontline of these pressures: Greece and Portugal, on the one hand, where the problems are primarily fiscal in nature; and Ireland and Spain, on the other, where banking problems related to the property boom and bust have been the key moving part. The paper first examines the probabilities of default implicit in observable market spreads and considers these calculations against sovereign debt dynamics. It then explores the implications of the interaction between bank losses and fiscal deficits on the one hand, and the feedback that any debt haircuts anticipated by markets could have on bank solvency. The study finds that market-implied sovereign default probabilities do in fact discriminate quite clearly between countries based on five criteria that affect the probability of debt restructuring. The discussion highlights some implications for banking system balance sheets of expected losses and shows the potential impact on them of sovereign restructuring implicit in market analysis. While the paper does not make any recommendations for policy action, it does explore a range of policy options and the implications each might have for the financial markets.

The dynamics of the financial crisis were driven by underpricing of risk and lack of transparency, which led to a loss of confidence when the bubble finally burst. Crisis resolution involved massive government interventions that caused a permanent transfer of losses to the public sector as well as sovereign-debt crises that may involve painful solutions. Letting banks fail is a necessary disciplinary factor, but this requires a well-defined “game plan” which did not exist in the crisis. Regulatory reforms underway aim at restoring confidence, but they may hamper the long-term potential of institutional investors. Nevertheless, institutional investors should still be able to provide risk capital – except for perhaps pension funds, which have been weakened by demographic developments. Finally, improving governance and reducing excessive risk-taking are important but challenging tasks. More active and involved shareholders could further these goals, but such participation will be hard to achieve. Therefore, transparent bonus and remuneration plans are perhaps the most important initiatives for preventing future systemic financial crises.", "title_en": "Lessons from the Last Financial Crisis and the Future Role of Institutional Investors"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4068097-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Rohde, Lars", "year": "2011", "type": "Article", "language_original": "en"}}

This paper empirically explores the impact of pension funds on market volatility, equity prices, government and corporate bond yields for a panel of 24 countries.

In addition, equity prices are found to be positively correlated with pension funds, a finding observable for both OECD countries and emerging market economies (EMEs) and present in both the short and long terms. Furthermore, there is evidence indicating a negative link between pension fund assets and both corporate and government bond yields.

Discussions at the October 2010 OECD Financial Roundtable conveyed a rather sombre view regarding the current outlook and risks, heightened by financial sector weaknesses, ongoing deleveraging and sovereign debt. Policy makers should be prepared for downside risks to materialise along the way to recovery. Low interest rates and low returns pose specific challenges for institutional investors. While sovereign risk is currently a major concern, its measurement is rather complex and markets do not always provide proper guidance. Sovereign ratings can serve as a useful point of reference but should be made more forward-looking and less procyclical. Should default or debt restructuring become necessary, strong political backing can minimise its costs. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was seen as helpful in providing a backstop. Some optimism was expressed as to the current fiscal adjustments underway to bring public finances back onto a sustainable path. Banking sectors remain fragile, especially in Europe, where, however, the transparency provided by recent stress tests has calmed some fears. Reactivating the wholesale markets for bank funding will be essential going forward. Capitalisation of the US banking sector has improved, but pockets of risk remain in exposures to commercial property by regional and small banks. Contingent convertible (bail-in) bonds could become a useful instrument for sharing the costs of crises, but they need to be made attractive for investors.
