The conference series was initiated at a 1993 meeting of the SPIE in San Jose, with subsequent meetings hosted every two years by researchers around the world. Previous meetings were held in York, Chicago, Nijmegen, Toronto, Bremen, and North Carolina. It is interesting to re?ect on the changes that have occurred during the past 13 years. Then, the dominant technology was ?lm-screen mammography; now it is full-?eld digital mammography. Then, there were few screening programmes world-wide; now there are many. Then, there was the hope that computer-aided detection (CAD) of early signs of cancer might be possible; now CAD is not only a reality but (more importantly) a commercially led clinical reality. Then, algorithmswerealmostentirelyheuristicwithlittleclinicalsupport;nowthereis arequirementforsubstantialclinicalsupportforanyalgorithmthatisdeveloped and published. However, upon re?ection, could we have predicted with absolute certainty what would be the key questions to be addressed over the subsequent (say) six years? No!

A uniquefeatureoftheconferenceistheemphasisonparticipationfrompractiti- ers. The objective is to illuminate critical issues and energize both communities for the continuing exploration of novel directions for image and video retrieval. We receivedover 90 submissions for the conference. Eachpaper wascarefully reviewed by three members of the program committee, and then checked by one of the program chairs and/or general chairs. The program committee consisted of more than 40 experts in image and video retrieval from Europe, Asia and North America, and we drew upon approximately 300 high-quality reviews to ensure a thorough and fair review process. The paper submission and review process was fully electronic, using the EDAS system. The quality of the submitted papers was very high, forcing the committee members to make some di?cult decisions.

Keyword index The near-field earthquake which struck the Hanshin-Awaji area of Japan before dawn on January 17, 1995, in addition to snatching away the lives of more than 6,000 people, inflicted horrendous damage on the region's infrastructure, including the transportation, communication and lifeline supply network and, of course, on buildings, too. A year earlier, the San Fernando Valley area of California had been hit by another near-field quake, the Northridge Earthquake, which dealt a similarly destructive blow to local infrastructures. Following these two disasters, structural engineers and researchers around the world have been working vigorously to develop methods of design for the kind of structure that is capable of withstanding not only the far-field tectonic earthquakes planned for hitherto, but also the full impact of near-field earthquake. Of the observed types of earthquake damage to steel structures, there are some whose causes are well understood, but many others continue to present us with unresolved problems. To overcome these, it is now urgently necessary for specialists to come together and exchange information.

Health problems such as hypertension, tendency to diabetes, obesity, blood lipids, vascular disease, bone health, behaviour and learning and longevity may be 'imprinted' during early life. This process is defined as 'programming' whereby a nutritional stimulus operating at a critical, sensitive period of pre and postnatal life imprints permanent effects on the structure, physiology and metabolism. For this reason, academics and industry set-up the EC supported Scientific Workshop -Early Nutrition and its Later Consequences: New Opportunities. The prime objective of the Workshop was to generate a sound exchange of the latest scientific developments within the field of early nutrition to look for opportunities for new preventive health concepts. Further, a closer look was taken at the development of food applications which could provide (future) mothers and infants with improved nutrition that will ultimately lead to better future health.

Currently, wireless sensor networks introduce innovative and interesting application scenarios that may support a large amount of different applications including environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, building automation, object tracking, nuclear reactor control, fire detection, agriculture, healthcare, and traffic monitoring. The widespread acceptance of these new services can be improved by the definition of frameworks and architectures that have the potential to radically simplify software development for wireless sensor network based applications. The aim of these new architectures is to support flexible, scalable programming of applications based on adaptive middleware. As a consequence, WSNs require novel programming paradigms and technologies.

As distinct from other security and cryptography conferences, the Information Security Conference (ISC) 2002 brought together individuals involved in a wide variety of different disciplines of information security to foster the exchange of ideas. The conference is an outgrowth of the Information Security Workshop, first held in Ishikawa, Japan 1997. ISC 2002 was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on September 30– October 2, 2002. The Program Committee considered 81 submissions of which 38 papers were accepted for presentation. These proceedings contain revised versions of the accepted papers. The papers provide a representative sample of both the variety and the truly international scope of information security research conducted currently. The topics addressed range from e-commerce protocols to access control and trust management, and to cryptography and cryptographic algorithms. Many people deserve our gratitude for their contribution to the success of the conference. We would like to thank the General Chair, Routo Terada, for overseeing the local arrangements, including registration and maintaining the conference website, and for the smooth running of the conference. We are grateful to Robbie Ye for his expert help in processing the electronic submissions, reviews and acceptance notifications.

The term “control theory” refers to the body of results - theoretical, numerical and algorithmic - which have been developed to influence the evolution of the state of a given system in order to meet a prescribed performance criterion. Systems of interest to control theory may be of very different natures. This monograph is concerned with models that can be described by partial differential equations of evolution. It contains five major contributions and is connected to the CIME Course on Control of Partial Differential Equations that took place in Cetraro (CS, Italy), July 19 - 23, 2010. Specifically, it covers the stabilization of evolution equations, control of the Liouville equation, control in fluid mechanics, control and numerics for the wave equation, and Carleman estimates for elliptic and parabolic equations with application to control. We are confident this work will provide an authoritative reference work for all scientists who are interested in this field, representing at the same time a friendly introduction to, and an updated account of, some of the most active trends in current research. 1 On some recent advances on stabilization for hyperbolic equations -- 2 Notes on the Control of the Liouville Equation -- 3 Some questions of control in ﬂuid mechanics -- 4 Carleman estimates and some applications to control theory -- 5 The Wave Equation: Control and Numerics.", "title_en": "Control of Partial Differential Equations : Cetraro, Italy 2010, Editors: Piermarco Cannarsa, Jean-Michel Coron"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4032317-1", "gnd:4044779-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Alabau-Boussouira, Fatiha", "year": "2012", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

In the recent decade, there has been a growing interest in the numerical treatment of high-dimensional problems. It is well known that classical numerical discretization schemes fail in more than three or four dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality. The technique of sparse grids helps overcome this problem to some extent under suitable regularity assumptions. This discretization approach is obtained from a multi-scale basis by a tensor product construction and subsequent truncation of the resulting multiresolution series expansion. This volume of LNCSE is a collection of the papers from the proceedings of the workshop on sparse grids and its applications held in Bonn in May 2011.

The study of the geometry of infinite vertex transitive graphs, and of Cayley graphs in particular, is fairly well developed.

The growing interest in these methods is due in part to the fact that they are extremely flexible numerical tools and can be interpreted in a number of ways. For instance, meshfree methods can be viewed as a natural extension of classical finite element and finite difference methods to scattered node configurations with no fixed connectivity. Furthermore, meshfree methods offer a number of advantageous features which are especially attractive when dealing with multiscale phenomena: a priori knowledge about particular local behavior of the solution can easily be introduced in the meshfree approximation space, and coarse-scale approximations can be seamlessly refined with fine-scale information.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1654798436", "content": {"text": "Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics : Varna, Bulgaria, June 2013. Traditionally, Lie theory is a tool to build mathematical models for physical systems. Recently, the trend is towards geometrization of the mathematical description of physical systems and objects. A geometric approach to a system yields in general some notion of symmetry which is very helpful in understanding its structure. Geometrization and symmetries are meant in their widest sense, i.e., representation theory, algebraic geometry, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, superalgebras and supergroups, groups and quantum groups, noncommutative geometry, symmetries of linear and nonlinear PDE, special functions, and others. Furthermore, the necessary tools from functional analysis and number theory are included. This is a big interdisciplinary and interrelated field. Samples of these fresh trends are presented in this volume, based on contributions from the Workshop \"Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics\" held near Varna (Bulgaria) in June 2013.

Featuring forty-six papers by policy-makers, academics and consultants, it discusses current groundbreaking research in smart and sustainable planning, including the progress made in overcoming cities’ challenges towards improving the quality of life. Climate change adaptation and mitigation of global warming, generally identified as drivers of global policies, are just the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to smart energy transition. Indeed, equally relevant towards this current transformation – and key topics in this volume – are ICTs, public spaces and society; next economy for the city; strategies and actions for good governance; urban-rural innovation; rethinking mobility.

The study of materials which exhibit new and unconventional properties is of central importance for the devel- opment of advanced and refined technologies in many fields of engineering science. In this connection there has been a rapidly growing interest in real fluid effects on wave phenomena in the past few years. A prominent example is provided by Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) fluids which have the distinguishing feature that they exhibit negative nonlinearity over a finite range of temperature and pressures in the pure vapour phase. However, two phase flows with and without phase change are an even richer source of new unexpected and previously thought impossible phenomena. Topics covered by this volume include waves in gases near the critical point, waves in retrograde fluids, temperature waves in superfluid helium and density waves in suspensions of particles in liquids. Clearly, the aim of the various contributions is twofold. First, they are intended to provide scientists and engineers working in these and related areas with an overview of various new physical phenomena as for example expansion shocks, sonic shocks, shock splitting, evaporation and liquafaction shocks and the experimental techniques needed to study these phenomena.

Growth in mammals encompasses several stages, from intrauterine growth through infancy and childhood to adolescence. Each of these phases is characterized by very specific nutritional, molecular and endocrine perspectives which, under ideal conditions, allow the organism to achieve its genetically programmed growth patterns.In this book, an international panel of experts addresses these topics in a historical, physiological and social perspective. The first part investigates the genetic, epigenetic, molecular and nutritional determinants of intrauterine and postnatal growth. Part two deals with non-evolutionary changes which occurred in the recent past, such as changes in body size in utero, during infancy and childhood, and during adolescence, and the potentially unfavorable consequences of enhanced nutrition and growth, including early onset of puberty, development of obesity, and increases in metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The last part addresses the question of which factors define healthy growth in light of the influence of nutritional, molecular and endocrine influences. Although the association between rapid changes in body size and adverse health effects is clear, the precise nature of causality remains uncertain.

The architect Eduardo Souto de Moura (b. 1952) has won many accolades, including the 2011 Pritzker Architecture Prize. Based in Porto, Souto de Moura studied under Fernando Tavora and worked under fellow Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza, with whom he continues to collaborate. Souto de Moura established his own practice in 1980, and his wide-ranging influences, including Mies van der Rohe and Donald Judd, can be seen in the stunning variety of his work, from his acclaimed private houses, to the striking Paula Rego Museum in Cascais and the Braga Municipal Stadium, to his work in historical contexts such as the Convento das Bernardas in Tavira. This beautifully illustrated retrospective provides the most comprehensive account of Souto de Moura's career to date.

This volume is an important contribution to the conceptualization of the largest empire of Late Antiquity. While previous studies used Iraq as the paradigm for the entire empire, this volume looks at diverse regions instead. After a theoretical introduction to the concept of 'elites' in an early Islamic context, the papers focus on elite structures and networks within selected regions of the Empire (Transoxiana, Khurāsān, Armenia, Fārs, Iraq, al-Jazīra, Syria, Egypt, and Ifrīqiya). The papers analyze elite groups across social, religious, geographical, and professional boundaries. Although each region appears unique at first glance, based on their heterogeneous surviving sources, its physical geography, and its indigenous population and elites, the studies show that they shared certain patterns of governance and interaction, and that this was an important factor for the success of the largest empire of Late Antiquity", "title_en": "The Early Islamic Empire at Work : Volume 1: Transregional and Regional Elites - Connecting the Early Islamic Empire"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4359141-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2020", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Continuing the theme of the previous volume, these seminar notes reflect general trends in the study of Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, understood in a broad sense. Two classical topics represented are the Concentration of Measure Phenomenon in the Local Theory of Banach Spaces, which has recently had triumphs in Random Matrix Theory, and the Central Limit Theorem, one of the earliest examples of regularity and order in high dimensions. Central to the text is the study of the Poincaré and log-Sobolev functional inequalities, their reverses, and other inequalities, in which a crucial role is often played by convexity assumptions such as Log-Concavity. The concept and properties of Entropy form an important subject, with Bourgain's slicing problem and its variants drawing much attention. Constructions related to Convexity Theory are proposed and revisited, as well as inequalities that go beyond the Brunn–Minkowski theory. One of the major current research directions addressed is the identification of lower-dimensional structures with remarkable properties in rather arbitrary high-dimensional objects.

Digitisation and mechanisation, in conjunction with network phenomena, are fundamentally changing the working and organisational world. They are both a complexity driver and a facilitator. The results of this for the social sector are accordingly multifaceted: new technology-based fields of work are emerging, powerful market players are appearing in changed value creation structures, and both management paradigms and specific requirements for employees and management are changing. Theory and practice are trying to conceptually grasp this new reality from a solution-oriented management perspective: exploration instead of exploitation, disruption instead of evolution or the contradictory concept of organisational ambidexterity. The contributions in this conference volume approach the facets of this complex phenomenon in an interdisciplinary manner, whereby theory and practice can meet on an equal footing, with the result that theoretical and empirical findings alternate with practical tests and findings.

Experts from a range of disciplines explore how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. Humans are not limited to a fixed set of innate or preprogrammed tasks. We learn quickly through language and other forms of natural interaction, and we improve our performance and teach others what we have learned. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of new tasks through natural interaction is an ongoing challenge. Advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics are leading us to future systems with human-like capabilities. A huge gap exists, however, between the highly specialized niche capabilities of current machine learning systems and the generality, flexibility, and in situ robustness of human instruction and learning. Drawing on expertise from multiple disciplines, this Strüngmann Forum Report explores how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. The contributors consider functional knowledge requirements, the ontology of interactive task learning, and the representation of task knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. They explore natural forms of interactions among humans as well as the use of interaction to teach robots and software agents new tasks in complex, dynamic environments. They discuss research challenges and opportunities, including ethical considerations, and make proposals to further understanding of interactive task learning and create new capabilities in assistive robotics, healthcare, education, training, and gaming.", "title_en": "Interactive task learning : humans, robots, and agents acquiring new tasks through natural interactions"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4120666-6", "gnd:4125909-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1091787182; gnd:1222440229", "year": "2018", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Klappentext: This book presents a broad overview of the important recent progress which led to the emergence of new ideas in Lipschitz geometry and singularities, and started to build bridges to several major areas of singularity theory. Providing all the necessary background in a series of introductory lectures, it also contains Pham and Teissier's previously unpublished pioneering work on the Lipschitz classification of germs of plane complex algebraic curves. While a real or complex algebraic variety is topologically locally conical, it is in general not metrically conical; there are parts of its link with non-trivial topology which shrink faster than linearly when approaching the special point. The essence of the Lipschitz geometry of singularities is captured by the problem of building classifications of the germs up to local bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. The Lipschitz geometry of a singular space germ is then its equivalence class in this category. The book is aimed at graduate students and researchers from other fields of geometry who are interested in studying the multiple open questions offered by this new subject.", "title_en": "Introduction to Lipschitz geometry of singularities : lecture notes of the International School on Singularity Theory and Lipschitz Geometry, Cuernavaca, June 2018"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4164905-9", "gnd:4569806-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1211528561; gnd:1226233422", "year": "2020", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Over the years, the electric power industry has been using optimization methods to help them solve the unit commitment problem. The result has been savings of tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel costs. Things are changing, however. Optimization technology is improving, and the industry is undergoing radical restructuring. Consequently, the role of commitment models is changing, and the value of the improved solutions that better algorithms might yield is increasing. The dual purpose of this book is to explore the technology and needs of the next generation of computer models for aiding unit commitment decisions. Because of the unit commitment problem's size and complexity and because of the large economic benefits that could result from its improved solution, considerable attention has been devoted to algorithm development in the book. More systematic procedures based on a variety of widely researched algorithms have been proposed and tested. These techniques have included dynamic programming, branch-and-bound mixed integer programming (MIP), linear and network programming approaches, and Benders decomposition methods, among others. Recently, metaheuristic methods have been tested, such as genetic programming and simulated annealing, along with expert systems and neural networks. Because electric markets are changing rapidly, how UC models are solved and what purposes they serve need reconsideration. Hence, the book brings together people who understand the problem and people who know what improvements in algorithms are really possible.

Knowledge presupposes the observation of order structures or their creation through abstraction and modelling. Contributions from different areas of university research examine structures that relate to (partially) autonomous actors (or agents) and the dynamic processes in which they are developed. Processes of knowledge that take place in this context require structures of order that can be experienced interobjectively, and in some cases can also be grasped in symbolism and rituals, even if these structures are created simultaneously with processes of action or knowledge. Recursive references can lead to forms of self-organization. In more highly developed structures, aspects of knowledge, learning (and forgetting) can be included and additionally strengthened or weakened by emotional states.On November 5, 2005, scientists came together for a workshop on \"Formation of Order and Knowledge Processes\" at the University of Hamburg.

Rethinking Economics is a major contribution to the reconstruction of an economic theory appropriate to the 21st century. Just as major changes are occurring in the world economy, economics itself is on the brink of change. Orthodox economics is now widely criticized for its sterility and its limited applicability to real-world economic problems. Standard theoretical tools such as general equilibrium theory are now regarded, even by their leading practitioners, as highly limited and problematic. New ideas from chaos theory, evolutionary modelling and institutional theory point to new, non-reductionist approaches in which there are units of analysis other than the atomistic individual. This work addresses core economic concepts, such as individual choice, prices, markets, production, industries, technology, innovation and economic growth in the light of these developments.

The publication presents an overview over the objectives, the organization, the content and the results of the conference. The background for organizing the venue refers to the fact that during the last ten years \"regional governance\" has become a topic of scientific discussion, fueled by the influence of globalization, the EC policies (structural funds, ESDP-process, Committee of the Regions etc.) and regionalization strategies of the member states. In addition, the EC has organized a discourse on \"governance\" in the wake of the \"Nice-process\". The objectives of the conference were: to get more insights into the present discussion on \"regional governance\", to identify open research questions concerning the general topic, to organize an academic discourse between younger and senior researchers within Europe and to mobilize young researchers of different member states of the EC to form research networks on some of the identified research questions.", "title_en": "Regional governance : new modes of self-government in the European Community ; EuroConference 19. - 21.

The question of a possible temporal variation of the fundamental constants was raised by Paul Dirac in his \"large number hypothesis\" in 1937. Today it appears in the context of the search for a unified theory of the fundamental interactions. It touches both fundamental and applied physics, as the postulate of the unalterability of the constants is the foundation for modern metrology. The book presents reviews written by leading experts in the field. Focussing on the question of variations of the fundamental \"constants\" in time or space, the chapters cover the theoretical framework in which variations are expected and the search for variations of quantities like the fine-structure constant, the electron/proton mass ratio, g-factors of proton and neutron etc. in astrophysical and geophysical observations and in precision experiments with atomic clocks and frequency standards.

Statistical learning theory is aimed at analyzing complex data with necessarily approximate models. This book is intended for an audience with a graduate background in probability theory and statistics. It will be useful to any reader wondering why it may be a good idea, to use asis often done in practice a notoriously \"wrong'' (i.e. over-simplified) model to predict, estimate or classify. This point of view takes its roots in three fields: information theory, statistical mechanics, and PAC-Bayesian theorems. Results on the large deviations of trajectories of Markov chains with rare transitions are also included. They are meant to provide a better understanding of stochastic optimization algorithms of common use in computing estimators. The author focuses on non-asymptotic bounds of the statistical risk, allowing one to choose adaptively between rich and structured families of models and corresponding estimators. Two mathematical objects pervade the book: entropy and Gibbs measures. The goal is to show how to turn them into versatile and efficient technical tools,that will stimulate further studies and results.

The question of a possible temporal variation of the fundamental constants was raised by Paul Dirac in his \"large number hypothesis\" in 1937. Today it appears in the context of the search for a unified theory of the fundamental interactions. It touches both fundamental and applied physics, as the postulate of the unalterability of the constants is the foundation for modern metrology. The book presents reviews written by leading experts in the field. Focussing on the question of variations of the fundamental \"constants\" in time or space, the chapters cover the theoretical framework in which variations are expected and the search for variations of quantities like the fine-structure constant, the electron/proton mass ratio, g-factors of proton and neutron etc. in astrophysical and geophysical observations and in precision experiments with atomic clocks and frequency standards.

These conference proceedings present a series of evaluations of agri-environmental policies in OECD countries. They examine how effective the policies have been in achieving objectives and what policy makers have learned about the design and implementation of their policies. These proceedings show that different methods of policy evaluation are complementary. Most countries focus on evaluating the environmental effectiveness rather than the economic efficiency of policies, using physical indicators rather than monetary values. Many policies are achieving their environmental objectives, but are taking longer than originally anticipated. The initiative being taken in many countries to incorporate monitoring and data collection into program design and implementation is a positive development. But a number of steps need to be taken to improve the quality of evaluations, including the better articulation of policy goals and objectives, improving data quality and establishing baselines for comparison.--Publisher's summary", "title_en": "Evaluating agri-environmental policies : design, practice and results ; [OECD Workshop on Evaluating Agri-Environmental Policies ... held on 6 - 8 December 2004 in Paris]"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4136995-6"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:10116795-7; gnd:5157-3", "year": "2005", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

CESifo Seminar Series \"Competitive Failures in Insurance Markets Theory and Policy Implications\" edited by Pierre-André Chiappori and Christian Gollier Risk sharing is a cornerstone of modern economies. It is valuable to risk-averse consumers and essential for investment and entrepreneurs. The standard economic model of risk exchange predicts that competition in insurance markets will result in all individual risks being insured--that all diversifiable risks in the economy will be covered through mutual risk-sharing arrangements--but in practice this is not the case. Many diversifiable risks are still borne by individuals; many environmental, catastrophic, and technological risks are not covered by insurance contracts. In this CESifo volume, leading international economists provide new insights on recent developments in the economic analysis of the limits of insurability. They find that asymmetric information is a central reason why competition in insurance markets may fail to guarantee that mutually advantageous risk exchanges are realized in today's economies. In particular, adverse selection and moral hazard help explain why competitive insurance markets fail to provide an efficient level of insurance and hence why public intervention is required to solve the problem. The contributors offer theoretical models of insurance markets involving adverse selection as well as empirical analyses of health insurance and non-health insurance markets in countries including Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.", "title_en": "Competitive failures in insurance markets : theory and policy implications"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4114528-8"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2006", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This international scientific conference aimed at addressing the current and pot- tial role of satellite remote sensing in climate modeling, with a particular focus on land surface processes and atmospheric aerosol characterization. Global and regional circulation models incorporate our knowledge ofthe dynamics ofthe Earth's atmosphere. They are used to predict the evolution of the weather and climate. Mathematically, this system is represented by a set ofpartial differential equations whose solution requires initial and bo- dary conditions. Limitations in the accuracy and geographical distribution of these constraints, and intrinsic mathematical sensitivity to these conditions do not allow the identification of a unique solution (prediction). Additional observations on the climate system are thus used to constrain the forecasts of the mathematical model to remain close to the observed state ofthe system.", "title_en": "Remote Sensing and Climate Modeling: Synergies and Limitations"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4114528-8", "gnd:4016796-3", "gnd:4164199-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Beniston, Martin", "year": "2003", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

Sophisticated instruments allow us to compare galaxies at high redshifts, when the Universe was only a few hundred millions years old, with the mature nearby galaxies we see today. This is yielding new insights into the mass assembly and the star formation history of galaxies that may, or may not, be compatible with our current theoretical models.

Bring a new level of effectiveness to your software projectsRemember when creating software was fun? It could be again, if you use the methods in this book to help you plan and manage your project. In this new edition of The Software Project Manager's Handbook, expert Dwayne Phillips outlines the fundamental principles that project managers and software practitioners can use to help them succeed on any project. Success on software projects has more to do with how people think individually and in groups than with programming, asserts Phillips. In clear and concise steps, he shows software project managers and their team members how to manage projects effectively by paying attention to four basic principles: . Balancing people, process, and product . Making ideas visible . Applying configuration management properly . Using standards The book describes the requirements, planning, and risk management stages of the development cycle and examines the middle and late stages of development including design, test and integration, and maintenance. Phillips shares proven methods for dealing with common stumbling blocks for managers such as customers who want a voice in the design and endless test-fix cycles, and for planning maintenance so the customer is not left out of the process. Finally, the author examines past projects in detaildemonstrating why some projects were successful and why others failed. Phillips helps you apply these lessons with a \"cookbook\" formula that walks you step-by-step through a Waterfall, an Evolutionary, and a Spiral project.New material added to each chapter covers current issues including the role of process in software projects and the Agile Methods.

This collection covers a wide range of topics of infinite dimensional dynamical systems generated by parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations, solitary equations, lattice differential equations, delay differential equations, and stochastic differential equations.Infinite dimensional dynamical systems are generated by equations describing the evolution in time of systems whose status must be depicted in infinite dimensional phase spaces. Studying the long-term behaviors of such systems is important in our understanding of their spatiotemporal pattern formation and global continuation, and has been among the major sources of motivation and applications of new developments in nonlinear analysis and other mathematical theories. The theory of infinite dimensional dynamical systems has also increasingly important applications in the physical, chemical and life sciences.This book collects 19 papers from 48 invited lecturers to the International Conference on Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems held at York University, Toronto, in September of 2008. As the conference was dedicated to Professor George Sell from University of Minnesota on the occasion of his 70th birthday, this collection reflects his pioneering work and influence in core areas of dynamical systems, including non-autonomous dynamical systems, skew-product flows, invariant manifolds theory, infinite dimensional dynamical systems, approximation dynamics, and fluid flows.", "title_en": "Infinite dimensional dynamical systems"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4013396-5", "gnd:4207956-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2013", "type": "Conference", "language_original": "en"}}

This proceedings volume contains nine selected papers that were presented in the International Symposium in Statistics, 2012 held at Memorial University from July 16 to 18. These nine papers cover three different areas for longitudinal data analysis, four dealing with longitudinal data subject to measurement errors, four on incomplete longitudinal data analysis, and the last one for inferences for longitudinal data subject to outliers. Unlike in the independence setup, the inferences in measurement errors, missing values, and/or outlier models, are not adequately discussed in the longitudinal setup. The papers in the present volume provide details on successes and further challenges in these three areas for longitudinal data analysis. This volume is the first outlet with current research in three important areas in the longitudinal setup. The nine papers presented in three parts clearly reveal the similarities and differences in inference techniques used for three different longitudinal setups.
