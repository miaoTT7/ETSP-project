Laser Sintering (LS) with plastics is one of the most promising additive manufacturing technologies: it is currently regarded as the process most likely in the future to permanently cross the border between prototyping and the production of functional parts. This step is challenging because it means that the technology must meet certain requirements that are also valid for traditional and established production processes. Only by succeeding at this step can a wide industry acceptance of LS be expected in the future. In this context, this book covers all levels of the LS process chain, including: - Current state of the machine technology - Essential process steps, both before and during sintering - Specific demands of the materials, powder production methods, and evaluation of powder properties - Mechanical properties and density of the parts produced by LS Examples of LS-produced parts are given, including those with special design features, to illustrate the characteristics and also the limitations of the LS method. In particular, the distinct advantages of LS parts over parts produced with other plastics processing methods (e.g., injection molding) are discussed--", "title_en": "Laser sintering with plastics : technology, processes, and materials"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4166071-7", "gnd:4803022-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1077575955; gnd:2007034-2", "year": "2018", "type": "Report", "language_original": "de"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1040973280", "content": {"text": "Sequential disaster forensics : an application to floods in the city of Grimma. Disaster risk and losses have been steadily rising in the past decades, highlighting the need to learn from past events. Only a better understanding of the fundamental causes of natural disasters and its impacts on societies can lead to an effective prevention and reduction of disaster risk. In this context, disaster forensics focuses on the analysis and interaction of risk factors (i.e. hazard, exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity) and the identification of underlying risk drivers, in order to tackle them through dedicated action. Results from forensic analysis are twofold: On the one hand, context-specific knowledge to decide on appropriate and evidence-based Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) measures to mitigate current risk and prevent future one. On the other hand, more generalizable knowledge and evidence on how disaster risk is generated and on the effectiveness of applied DRR measures. In this work, we explore results of disaster forensics through a case study of subsequent floods in 2002 and 2013 in the city of Grimma, Saxony, in Germany. Risk factors are investigated to identify their contribution in increasing or reducing disaster damage, in conjunction with socio-economic impacts on age structure and migration in the mostly affected inner city of Grimma. In particular, we analyse: (i) How much the sequential application of disaster forensics contributes to a better understanding of risk and the identification of the causes of disasters impacts; and (ii) what data are required for performing a disaster forensic analysis. Katastrophenrisiken und -schäden sind in den letzten Jahrzehnten stetig gestiegen und unterstreichen die Notwendigkeit, aus vergangenen Ereignissen zu lernen. Nur ein besseres Verständnis der grundlegenden Ursachen von Naturkatastrophen und ihrer Auswirkungen auf die Gesellschaft kann zu einer wirksamen Prävention und Reduzierung des Katastrophenrisikos führen. In diesem Zusammenhang konzentriert sich die Katastrophenforensik auf die Analyse und das Zusammenspiel von Risikofaktoren (d.h. Gefährdung, Exposition, Verletzlichkeit und Bewältigungskapazität) sowie die Identifizierung der zugrunde liegenden Risikotreiber, um diesen durch gezielte Maßnahmen zu begegnen. Die Ergebnisse der forensischen Analyse sind vielseitig: Auf der einen Seite kontextspezifisches Wissen, um evidenzbasiert über geeignete Maßnahmen zur Katastrophenrisikominderung (Disaster Risk Reduction, DRR) zu entscheiden, um das aktuelle Risiko zu mindern und zukünftiges einzudämmen. Andererseits verallgemeinerbares Wissen und Erkenntnisse darüber, wie Katastrophenrisiken entstehen und wie effektiv angewandte Risikoreduktionsmaßnahmen sind. In dieser Arbeit untersuchen mithilfe der Katastrophenforensik eine Fallstudie zweier sukzessiver Überschwemmungsereignisse in den Jahren 2002 und 2013 in der Stadt Grimma in Sachsen. Verschiedene Risikofaktoren werden untersucht, um ihren Beitrag zur Erhöhung oder Verringerung von Katastrophenschäden zu identifizieren. Dies geschieht unter Berücksichtigung der sozioökonomischen Auswirkungen auf die Altersstruktur und Migration in der am stärksten vom Hochwasser betroffenen Innenstadt von Grimma. Insbesondere analysieren wir: (i) Inwieweit die sequentielle Anwendung der Katastrophenforensik zu einem besseren Verständnis des Risikos und der Ursachen der Auswirkungen von Katastrophen beiträgt und (ii) welche Daten für die Durchführung einer forensischen Katastrophenanalyse benötigt werden.", "title_en": "Sequential disaster forensics : an application to floods in the city of Grimma"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4137042-9", "gnd:4186634-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Mendoza, Marina", "year": "2018", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

Set-valued analysis is an essential tool for the mathematical formulation of many real-life situations, e.g., equilibrium theory in mathematical economics. This work offers the first comprehensive treatment in book form of the fairly new subdiscipline of enlargements of maximal monotone operators, including several important new results in the field. In the last decades, with the development of nonsmooth optimization, effective algorithms have been developed to solve these kinds of problems, such as nonsmooth variational inequalities. Several of these methods, such as bundle methods for variational problems, are fully developed and analyzed in this book. The first chapters provide a self-contained review of the basic notions and fundamental results in set-valued analysis, including set convergence and continuity of set-valued mappings together with many important results in infinite-dimensional convex analysis, leading to the classical fixed point results due to Ekeland, Caristi and Kakutani. Next, an in-depth introduction to monotone operators is developed, emphasizing results related to maximality of subdifferentials and of sums of monotone operators. Building on this foundational material, the second part of the monograph contains new results (all of them established during the last decade) on the concept of enlargements of monotone operators, with applications to variational inequalities, bundle-type methods, augmented Lagrangian methods, and proximal point algorithms", "title_en": "Set-valued mappings and enlargements of monotone operators"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4137027-2", "gnd:4401290-1", "gnd:4138566-4"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Burachik, Regina S.; Iusem, Alfredo N.", "year": "2008", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

This book provides a molecular view of membrane transport by means of numerous biochemical and biophysical techniques. The rapidly growing number of atomic structures of transporters in different conformations and the constant progress in bioinformatics have recently added deeper insights. The unifying mechanism of energized solute transport across membranes is assumed to consist of the conformational cycling of a carrier protein to provide access to substrate binding sites from either side of a cellular membrane. Due to the central role of active membrane transport there is considerable interest in deciphering the principles of one of the most fundamental processes in nature: the alternating access mechanism. This book brings together particularly significant structure-function studies on a variety of carrier systems from different transporter families: Glutamate symporters, LeuT-like fold transporters, MFS transporters and SMR (RND) exporters, as well as ABC-type importers. The selected examples impressively demonstrate how the combination of functional analysis, crystallography, investigation of dynamics and computational studies has made it possible to create a conclusive picture, or, more precisely, a molecular movie. Although we are still far from a complete molecular description of the alternating access mechanism, remarkable progress has been made from static snapshots towards membrane transport dynamics. --", "title_en": "Membrane transport mechanism : 3D structure and beyond"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4038575-9", "gnd:4213127-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2014", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

The theory will probably enjoy substantial further growth, but even now a connected account of the mature parts of it makes a useful addition to the literature.

In 2000, the average driver in US metropolitan areas endured 27 hours of traffic delays, a rise from 7 hours in 1980. In many other countries, traffic delays are considerably worse than in the United States, and in developing countries urban traffic congestion is increasing with alarming rapidity. For fifty years, economists have been advocating congestion pricing as the way to deal with urban traffic congestion; but today, even after some successes, congestion pricing is encountering considerable political resistance. The authors of Alleviating Urban Traffic Congestion advocate active consideration of more microscopic policies that attack the problem at the scale at which actual policy decisions are made. Microscopic models, rather than macroscopic models that are too simplified and too aggregated, they argue, will lead to the analysis of a wider and more creative range of policies, at least some of which should work well and be politically acceptable. After developing the themes of the book, the authors illustrate them by examining some areas of urban transport policy that have been neglected by the macroscopic approach. These include downtown parking policy, the encouragement of bicycling, the staggering of work hours by dominant employers, and the use by medium-sized cities of a \"multimode\" ticket that charges cars entering the city center a toll equal to the transit fare. The reorientation of urban transport analysis that they advocate will by no means eliminate traffic delays but should speed up the adoption of a richer, more flexible, and ultimately more effective set of policies to alleviate urban traffic congestion.", "title_en": "Alleviating urban traffic congestion"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4056783-7", "gnd:4272352-8", "gnd:4062955-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:115055746; gnd:122220854; gnd:1117160289", "year": "2005", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

The author presents and structures the algorithms (hardware-oriented as well as software-oriented), and also discusses issues related to accurate floating-point implementation. The purpose is not to give \"cookbook recipes\" that allow one to implement a given function, but rather to provide the reader with tools necessary to build, or adapt, algorithms to their specific computing environment. The expanded second edition contains a number of revisions and additions, which incorporate numerous new results obtained during the last few years. New algorithms invented since 1997--such as Matula's bipartite method, another table-based method due to Ercegovac, Lang, Tisserand, and Muller--as well as a new chapter on multiple-precision arithmetic have been added. In addition, the section on correct rounding of elementary functions has been fully reworked, also in the context of new results. Finally, the introductory presentation of floating-point arithmetic has been expanded, with more emphasis given to the use of the fused multiply-accumulate instruction. The book is an up-to-date presentation of information needed to understand and accurately use mathematical functions and algorithms in computational work and design.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A1675975418", "content": {"text": "Squimera : a live, Smalltalk-based IDE for dynamic programming languages. Software development tools that work and behave consistently across different programming languages are helpful for developers, because they do not have to familiarize themselves with new tooling whenever they decide to use a new language. Also, being able to combine multiple programming languages in a program increases reusability, as developers do not have to recreate software frameworks and libraries in the language they develop in and can reuse existing software instead. However, developers often have a broad choice with regard to tools, some of which are designed for only one specific programming language. Various Integrated Development Environments have support for multiple languages, but are usually unable to provide a consistent programming experience due to different features of language runtimes. Furthermore, common mechanisms that allow reuse of software written in other languages usually use the operating system or a network connection as the abstract layer. Tools, however, often cannot support such indirections well and are therefore less useful in debugging scenarios for example. In this report, we present a novel approach that aims to improve the programming experience with regard to working with multiple high-level programming languages. As part of this approach, we reuse the tools of a Smalltalk programming environment for other languages and build a multi-language virtual execution environment which is able to provide the same runtime capabilities for all languages. The prototype system Squimera is an implementation of our approach and demonstrates that it is possible to reuse development tools, so that they behave in the same way across all supported programming languages. In addition, it provides convenient means to reuse and even mix software libraries and frameworks written in different languages without breaking the debugging experience. Programmierwerkzeuge, die verschiedene Programmiersprachen unterstützen und sich konsistent bedienen lassen, sind hilfreich für Softwareentwickler, weil diese sich nicht erst mit neuen Werkzeugen vertraut machen müssen, wenn sie in einer neuen Sprache entwickeln wollen. Außerdem ist es nützlich, verschiedene Programmiersprachen in einer Anwendung kombinieren zu können, da Entwickler dann Softwareframeworks und -bibliotheken nicht in der jeweiligen Sprache nachbauen müssen und stattdessen bestehende Software wiederverwenden können. Dennoch haben Entwickler eine sehr große Auswahl, wenn sie nach Werkzeugen suchen, die teilweise zudem speziell nur für eine Sprache ausgelegt sind. Einige integrierte Entwicklungsumgebungen unterstützen verschiedene Programmiersprachen, können aber häufig keine konsistente Bedienung ihrer Werkzeuge gewährleisten, da die jeweiligen Ausführungsumgebungen der Sprachen zu verschieden sind. Darüber hinaus gibt es bereits Mechansimen, die es erlauben, Programme aus anderen Sprachen in einem Programm wiederzuverwenden. Dazu werden häufig das Betriebssystem oder eine Netzwerkverbindung verwendet. Programmierwerkzeuge unterstützen jedoch häufig eine solche Indirektion nicht und sind deshalb nur eingeschränkt nutzbar bei beispielsweise Debugging Szenarien. In dieser Arbeit stellen wir einen neuartigen Ansatz vor, der das Programmiererlebnis in Bezug auf das Arbeiten mit mehreren dynamischen Programmiersprachen verbessern soll.

Evaluating the effectiveness of these crash countermeasures is crucial for the state highway safety improvement programs. According to the results of this study, these four countermeasures are generally cost-effective and successful in reducing crashes, particularly severe crashes. Estimated crash modification factors (CMFs) for total crashes are 0.83 for CLRS by the Empirical Bayes (EB) method. The CMF for the lane conversion to three and five-lane highways are 0.61 and 0.70 by EB method for segment, and 0.69 and 0.76 by Improved Prediction Method for segment plus intersection. The CMF for RCUT is 0.86 and 0.69 by Improved Prediction Method for RCUT section and intersection only. The CMF for RCUT intersection only is 0.80 by EB method. The CMF for roundabout with stop-sign on minor street (without layout change) is 0.32 and 0.28 by Improved Prediction and EB method. Except roundabout, the ratio of benefit to cost (B/C) is bigger or much bigger than one. Being the most expensive countermeasure, the B/C ratio of roundabout is less than one, but that estimation did not count the benefit from the improved traffic flow performance (reduced delay or saving in travel time) and long-time safety benefits (only three after years).\"--", "title_en": "Investigating safety impact of center line rumble strips, lane conversion, roundabout, and J-turn features on Louisiana highways"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4062962-4", "gnd:7727649-8", "gnd:4331587-2", "gnd:4197414-1", "gnd:4222416-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1161697373; gnd:1223465152; gnd:55196-X; gnd:10142093-6", "year": "2019", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

This study analyses the processes and assumptions underlying the development of Indonesia's NDC and its revision in 2020. The assumptions underlying the related energy sector documents (KEN, RUEN, RUKN, RUPTL) and their relationships are also assessed. The study is completed by giving a snapshot of the current state of discussion around constraints related to renewable energy. The unconditional target of Indonesia's NDC foresees a reduction of GHG emissions of 29% relative to a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario (41% conditional to international support). It specifies that electricity generation shall reduce emissions by 18.8% relative to BAU. The overall target of a 29% and 41% have been set by a non-public process. The sectoral shares of GHG reductions are determined by the responsible ministries (ESDM in case of the energy sector), with modelling performed by academic institutions (e.g. BTI for energy). This modelling is partly based on existing plans of the energy sector. Data underlying this modelling is not public, but underlying socio-economic assumptions suggest that the BAU scenario overestimates emissions. The NDC has no influence on planning in the energy sector but should be considered a by-product of existing planning documents. The process underlying the current revision is repeated for the current revision of the NDC and likely also for creation of the LTS. The ambition under the revised NDC will not be increased. The share of renewable energy in the NDC follows from a cascade of energy planning documents (KEN, RUEN, RUKN, RUPTL), which pass the target from the most overarching energy plans to the NDC. Arguably the most important target related to renewable energy planning in Indonesia set down by the countries' energy strategy KEN, to reach 23% renewable energy in each sector in total primary energy supply in 2025. The assumptions underlying this target are not known and can therefore not be contested. The national energy plan RUEN makes this target more specific in terms of technology. The power sector plan by the ministry of energy RUKN and the power sector plan by the utility RUPTL all consider 23% renewable energy target.

This study builds on three case studies in Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico which analyse the implications of falling costs for renewable energy systems on the countries' energy sector planning and climate policy. Each case study consists of two country specific reports. The first report analyses how falling costs of renewable energy could impact country specific power sector development. The second report analyses the process of climate and renewable energy target setting, as well as the prevalent narrative around renewable energy integration. Finally, the present report provides a cross-country synthesis of all case studies, providing insights into the question of how falling costs of renewable energy systems might support the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Globally falling cost figures for solar PV and wind energy do not naturally translate into increased ambition in planning. The integration of these technologies to the energy system still face substantial barriers in our case study countries: The integration of higher shares of renewable energy goes along with investments into transmission and distribution network modernisation, network expansion and interconnections between power grids. Though an important element, falling costs for renewable energy projects alone do not necessarily translate into overall reduced power system costs. While globally falling costs for wind and solar PV are indicative for learning curve effects in the manufacturing of these technologies, the LCOE of renewable projects is highly sensitive to financing costs. These are largely determined by the local political and regulatory framework and remain high in our case countries, representing a barrier. We find that a number of regulatory and administrative barriers hinder higher integration of solar PV and wind. Frequently changing regulations and ill-designed support schemes often prevail over welldesigned renewable energy auction schemes that are followed over several years.

The deployment of onshore wind power is an important means to mitigate climate change. However, wind turbines also produce local disamenities to residents living next to them, mainly due to noise emissions and visual effects. Our paper analyzes how the presence of local disamenities affects the socially optimal siting of onshore wind power. The analysis builds on a spatial optimization model using geographical information system (GIS) data for Germany. Our results indicate a major spatial trade-off between the goals of minimizing electricity generation and disamenity costs. Considering disamenity costs substantially alters - and in fact dominates - the socially optimal spatial allocation of wind power deployment. This is because in Germany a) the spatial correlation between generation costs and disamenity costs is only moderately positive, and b) disamenity costs exhibit a larger spatial heterogeneity than the generation costs. These results are robust to variations in the level and slope of the disamenity cost function that we assume for the modeling.

Electric vehicles (EVs) can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation sector. Therefore, the German government has defined various measures and targets to promote the diffusion of EVs. However, factors influencing the market diffusion of EVs as well as interdependencies between policy measures and vehicle diffusion are often unclear and hence, diffusion simulations are probably inaccurate. At the same time, a precise simulation of EV diffusion is a relevant parameter in travel demand models building the base for transportation planning. This paper addresses the gaps in current market diffusion models for EVs with a particular focus on environmental effects as additional influencing factors of the market diffusion. Results will be drawn for the German car market with a market diffusion simulation until 2050. The market diffusion model ALADIN is applied and energy prices are extended by a CO2 price to improve the consideration of environmental factors in the market diffusion modelling. The effectiveness of environmental policy measures is assessed in scenarios with three different CO2 prices and their impact on the diffusion of EVs. The results show that the market diffusion is highly dependent on the evolution of external factors. A CO2 price of at least 150 €/t of CO2 by 2030 can have a significant impact on the market diffusion of EVs and may as well lead to changes in the drive mix for both, electric and conventional drives within the German passenger car fleet. The German government’s target of seven to ten million EVs registered by 2030 seems in general achievable, if currently adopted purchase bonuses and expected cost degression for EVs also take effect. Until 2050, we find large effects with CO2 prices up to 500 €/t, yet limited growth in market share above that threshold.", "title_en": "Addressing the gaps in market diffusion modeling of electrical vehicles : a case study from Germany for the integration of environmental policy measures"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4055072-2", "gnd:4059277-7", "gnd:4062954-5", "gnd:4151795-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:142739138; gnd:1240863950; gnd:1078643768", "year": "2021", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

Steel is of extraordinary importance for the European economy as well as society, but is responsible for enormous energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, steel flows are an obvious subject for the European climate protection. The quantification of steel stocks and flows is useful to be included in discussions regarding Circular Economy, energy system transformation and resource efficiency. Therefore, we developed a retrospective and dynamic material flow model covering the entire European steel and iron cycle from 2002 to 2019. Based on data by Worldsteel and assumptions mainly adopted by Cullen et al. (2012), the value and production chain of steel and iron products is covered by the model. It appears that the European steel and iron use reached a saturation from 2007 on, where the stock of steel in anthropogenic use phase reached around 5,600 Mt. In 2019, around 140 Mt of steel left the use phase, of which circa 6 Mt dissipated or are abandoned in place. Out of the remaining scrap, 110 Mt were collected as secondary raw materials for recycling. Recycling of steel in Europe reached a peak of approx. 140 Mt in 2007, from where on recycling declined equally to overall steel production leading to an almost constant recycling input rate of 57 %. The decline of steel recycling did not significantly affect the collection of steel scrap, but led to an increase of iron and steel scrap export. In 2019, 110 Mt of steel and iron were recycled in Europe, 65 % via EAF, 25 % via BOF and the remaining via ironmaking. Post-consumer waste is by mass more important than new scraps from production and manufacturing as evident in an old scrap ratio of 73 %.

Complex projects developed under the model-driven engineering paradigm nowadays often involve several interrelated models, which are automatically processed via a multitude of model operations. Modular and incremental construction and execution of such networks of models and model operations are required to accommodate efficient development with potentially large-scale models. The underlying problem is also called Global Model Management. In this report, we propose an approach to modular and incremental Global Model Management via an extension to the existing technique of Generalized Discrimination Networks (GDNs). In addition to further generalizing the notion of query operations employed in GDNs, we adapt the previously query-only mechanism to operations with side effects to integrate model transformation and model synchronization. We provide incremental algorithms for the execution of the resulting extended Generalized Discrimination Networks (eGDNs), as well as a prototypical implementation for a number of example eGDN operations. Based on this prototypical implementation, we experiment with an application scenario from the software development domain to empirically evaluate our approach with respect to scalability and conceptually demonstrate its applicability in a typical scenario. Initial results confirm that the presented approach can indeed be employed to realize efficient Global Model Management in the considered scenario.

Since the lift-off of Sputnik in 1957, over 8,000 satellites and spacecraft have been launched from over thirty countries, costing hundreds of billions of dollars. While only about 350 people have made the incredible journey beyond our atmosphere, we all benefit in countless ways from the missions. An authoritative and accessible source that collects information on man's quest to explore the Universe, The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Space, provides a global perspective of our occupation and use of space, whether for scientific, industrial, commercial, technical, or military purposes. The authors set the stage by describing the space environment, orbits and ground tracks, launchers and launch sites. Subsequently, they discuss the main space applications (telecommunications, navigation and Earth observation, military), plus science missions, planetary exploration, and space stations.

Separation of scales plays a fundamental role in the understanding of the dynamical behaviour of complex systems in physics and other natural sciences.

A detailed introduction gives an overview of the subject and makes the later chapters accessible also to readers less familiar with the material. Although the general mathematical theory based on pseudodifferential calculus is presented in detail, there is an emphasis on concrete and relevant examples from physics.

Verlagsinfo: Since 1990, more than 10 million people have been killed in the civil wars of failed states, and hundreds of millions more have been deprived of fundamental rights. The threat of terrorism has only heightened the problem posed by failed states. When States Fail is the first book to examine how and why states decay and what, if anything, can be done to prevent them from collapsing. It defines and categorizes strong, weak, failing, and collapsed nation-states according to political, social, and economic criteria. And it offers a comprehensive recipe for their reconstruction. This book comprises fourteen essays by leading scholars and practitioners who help structure this disparate field of research, provide useful empirical descriptions, and offer policy recommendations. Robert Rotberg's substantial opening chapter sets out a theory and taxonomy of state failure. It is followed by two sets of chapters, the first on the nature and correlates of failure, the second on methods of preventing state failure and reconstructing those states that do fail. Economic jump-starting, legal refurbishing, elections, the demobilizing of ex-combatants, and civil society are among the many topics discussed.", "title_en": "When states fail : causes and consequences"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4264286-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2004", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

The main concern is transition of wall boundary layers, although one chapter is devoted to an approach based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The first three chapters summarize physical knowledge of the transition process, consider the stability equations and methods for predicting transition by linear stability theory, and describe efficient and accurate numerical methods for the solution of stability equations. Chapters 4 to 7 describe computer programs based on stability-theory approach to identify the location of transition in two- and three-dimensional incompressible and compressible flows, respectively, and Chapter 7 describes a computer program within the framework of parabolized stability equations.

The applications involving electromagnetism are so pervasive that it is difficult to estimate their contribution to modern life: generation and transmission of electric energy, electric motors and actuators, radio, television, magnetic information storage, and even the mundane little magnet used to hold papers to the refrigerator all use electromagnetic fields. This text not only provides students with a good theoretcial understanding of electromagnetic field equations but it also treats a large number of application. No topic is presented unless it is directly applicable to engineering design or unless it is needed for the understanding of another topic. Included in this new edition are more than 400 examples and exercises, exercising every topic in the book, 600 end-of-chapter problems, many of them applications or simplified applications. A new chapter introducing numerical methods into the electromagnetic curriculum discusses the finite element, finite difference and moment methods. The book is a comprehensive two-semester textbook. It is written in simple terms with all details of derivations included and all steps in solutions listed. It requires little beyond basic calculus and can be used for self study. The wealth of examples and alternative explanations makes it very approachable by students.

Probability matching priors, ensuring frequentist validity of posterior credible sets up to the desired order of asymptotics, are of substantial current interest. They can form the basis of an objective Bayesian analysis. In addition, they provide a route for obtaining accurate frequentist confidence sets, which are meaningful also to a Bayesian. This monograph presents, for the first time in book form, an up-to-date and comprehensive account of probability matching priors addressing the problems of both estimation and prediction. Apart from being useful to researchers, it can be the core of a one-semester graduate course in Bayesian asymptotics. Gauri Sankar Datta is a professor of statistics at the University of Georgia. He has published extensively in the fields of Bayesian analysis, likelihood inference, survey sampling, and multivariate analysis. Rahul Mukerjee is a professor of statistics at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta. He co-authored three other research monographs, including A Calculus for Factorial Arrangements in this series.

With the beginning of the year 1999, a further important step towards deeper integration of Europe took place: The European Monetary Union (EMU) was put into force. Undoubtedly, this has, beside other effects, also considerable effects on the economic geography of the integrating area. Possible and probable spatial effects of EMU was the motive to establish an international working group within the ARL-DATAR (Délégati-on à l'Aménagement du Territoire et à l'Action Régionale) cooperation agreement in order to shed some light on these effects. The present volume consists of papers having been elaborated by members of the working group. Considerations are made with regard to - consequences for the regions of a changed relationship in which countries being members of the euro-zone stand to each other, - macroeconomic consequences for regions of their being a member of EMU, - effects of the possible concentration of industrial activities in regions and of trends towards specialisation of regions in certain industries, - effects of EMU using a multiregional general equilibrium model, - distinguishing between static and dynamic effects of the Euro.

This book brings together a collection of innovative papers on strategies for analyzing the spatial and economic impacts of disasters.

They often create chaos and economic disequilibrium, and can also cause unexpected long-term, structural changes. Dynamic interactions among agents and behavioral adjustments in a disaster become complicated. The papers in this volume make notable progress in tackling these challenges through refinements of conventional methods, as well as new modeling frameworks and multidisciplinary, integrative strategies.

There has been considerable interest in the last two decades in the mechanical characterisation of thin film systems and small volumes of material using depth-sensing indentation tests. Usually, the principal goal of such testing is to obtain values for elastic modulus and hardness of the specimen material from experimental readings of indenter load and depth of penetration. But other properties such as residual stress, fracture toughness, and visco-elastic behavior may also be measured. The indentation technique can be used on both brittle and ductile materials where conventional testing may result in premature specimen fracture. The forces involved are usually in the millinewton range and measured with a resolution of a few nanonewtons while the depths of penetration are in the order of nanometres, hence the term \"nanoindentation\". This new edition of Nanoindentation includesa dedicated chapter on thin films, new material on dynamic analysis and creep, accounts of recent research, and three new appendices on nonlinear least squares fitting, frequently asked questions, and specifications for a nanoindentation instrument.

For the computation of robust optimal solutions, i.e., optimal solutions being insensitive with respect to random parameter variations, appropriate deterministic substitute problems are needed.

The book constitutes a compact review of the applications of effective field theory methods in flavour physics, with emphasis on heavy quark physics.

It covers the full range of theoretical tools related to the application of the effective field theory idea: Starting from the weak interactions as an effective theory derived from the standard model, well-established methods such as heavy quark effective theory, the heavy quark mass expansion and chiral perturbation theory are addressed. Also more recent ideas such as QCD factorization and soft collinear effective theory are outlined. Finally the standard model itself is viewed as an effective theory, allowing a model-independent look at the results of the new physics. The book should be useful for the advanced graduate student as well as for scientists who are interested in the theoretical toolkit used in the context of flavour physics.

For change projects to succeed, organizations must carry out targeted risk management. This certainly applies to the complex IT projects that are taking place under current market conditions! An important success factor in this is the continuous involvement of the client and other stakeholders. This is often entirely lacking or inadequate. However, a sound test management approach based on Risk & Requirement Based Testing helps to increase that involvement. It is aimed at identifying risks in connection with the development and implementation of an IT system, such as the loss of market share, compensation claims, damage to reputation or high maintenance costs. Test Management is not something that a Project Leader does 'on top of everything else'. There are countless activities that the Test Manager has to carry out. To provide insight into these activities and their relationship with each other, LogicaCMG has developed the Test Management Model. This model describes the Test Manager's activities from the start of a test project up to the moment of the information system's implementation, thus creating an integral whole. On the principle of Test Management = Risk Management, this book equips the reader to set up test projects, to manage them and to communicate with the stakeholders. Besides a description of the theory of each activity, the chapters provide as many hints and tips as possible: what works best in the Test Manager's working practice and what he should guard against.

Named for one of the great mathematicians of the twentieth century, Banach spaces figure prominently in the study of functional analysis, having applications to integral and differential equations, approximation theory, harmonic analysis, convex geometry, numerical mathematics, analytic complexity, and probability theory. This work, written by a distinguished specialist in functional analysis, is devoted to a comprehensive treatment of the history of Banach spaces and (abstract bounded) linear operators. While other comprehensive texts on Banach spaces focus on developments before 1950, this one is mainly devoted to the second half of the twentieth century. Banach space theory is presented as a part of a broad mathematics context, using tools from such areas as set theory, topology, algebra, combinatorics, probability theory, logic, etc. Equal emphasis is given to both spaces and operators. Numerous examples and counterexamples elucidate the scope of the underlying concepts. As a stimulus for further research, the text also contains many problems which have not been previously solved.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A393847152", "content": {"text": "Econometric theory and methods. Econometric Theory and Methods provides a unified treatment of modern econometric theory and practical econometric methods. The geometrical approach to least squares is emphasized, as is the method of moments, which is used to motivate a wide variety of estimators and tests. Simulation methods, including the bootstrap, are introduced early and used extensively. The book deals with a large number of modern topics. In addition to bootstrap and Monte Carlo tests, these include sandwich covariance matrix estimators, artificial regressions, estimating functions and the generalized method of moments, indirect inference, and kernel estimation. Every chapter incorporates numerous exercises, some theoretical, some empirical, and many involving simulation. Econometric Theory and Methods is designed for beginning graduate courses. The book is suitable for both one- and two-term courses at the Masters or Ph.D. level. It can also be used in a final-year undergraduate course for students with sufficient backgrounds in mathematics and statistics. FEATURES BLUnified Approach: New concepts are linked to old ones whenever possible, and the notation is consistent both within and across chapters wherever possible. BLGeometry of Ordinary Least Squares: Introduced in Chapter 2, this method provides students with valuable intuition and allows them to avoid a substantial amount of tedious algebra later in the text. BLModern Concepts Introduced Early: These include the bootstrap (Chapter 4), sandwich covariance matrices (Chapter 5), and artificial regressions (Chapter 6). BLInclusive Treatment of Mathematics: Mathematical and statistical concepts are introduced as they are needed, rather than isolated in appendices or introductory chapters not linked to the main body of the text. BLAdvanced Topics: Among these are models for duration and count data, estimating equations, the method of simulated moments, methods for unbalanced panel data, a variety of unit root and cointegration tests, conditional moment tests, nonnested hypothesis tests, kernel density regression, and kernel regression. BLChapter Exercises: Every chapter offers numerous exercises, all of which have been answered by the authors in the Instructor's Manual. Particularly challenging exercises are starred and their solutions are available at the authors' website, providing a way for instructors and interested students to cover advanced material.", "title_en": "Econometric theory and methods"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4431358-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:131697978; gnd:170393755", "year": "2004", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

The presentation is not at an advanced technical level and will be accessible to any interested academic person. Starting with the history of PV, the text outlines its relevance today and in the future. Then follows an introduction to the physical background of solar cells and the most important materials and technologies. Particular emphasis is placed on future developments and prospects from the viewpoint of a well-informed observer. The book goes beyond technology by also describing the path from the cell to the module to the system. It proceeds to the most important present and future applications, such as grid-connected and stand-alone systems. The composition and development of the markets and the role of PV in future energy systems will be considered. Finally, the discussion turns to the future energy supply structure, expected to move towards more distributed generation, and addresses synergies and possible competition from other carbon-free energy sources.

This book presents a systematic and focused study of the application of fuzzy sets to two basic areas of decision theory, namely Mathematical Programming and Matrix Game Theory. Apart from presenting most of the basic results available in the literature on these topics, the emphasis is on understanding their natural relationship in a fuzzy environment. The study of duality theory for fuzzy mathematical programming problem plays a key role in understanding this interrelationship. For this, a theoretical framework of duality in fuzzy mathematical programming and conceptualization of the solution of a fuzzy game is created on the lines of their crisp counterparts.

The objective of the interdisciplinary RETRO project supported by the German Federal Ministry for Educationand Research (BMBF) was to analyze current practice in planning procedures in terms of their ICZMcompatibility by means of a retrospective analysis of 10 large-scale project approval and planning procedures inthe German coastal zone so as to be able to provide guidelines for the implementation of ICZM in Germany onthis basis. Since the requirements for good ICZM practice have not been adequately specified to date, wedeveloped 17 criteria for good ICZM practice using, in particular, the existing EU ICZM papers as the basis.The focus here is on the procedural aspects of negotiation and integration as well as the material aspects of arelative strengthening of ecological sustainability. We operationalized the criteria through formulation of 55assessable indicators. This set of indicators for good ICZM practice can be used beyond the RETROframework as a basis for discussion in connection with the implementation of ICZM.The analysis of planning practice and of the underlying legal tools, which was conducted with an eye to ICZMcompatibility on the basis of the indicators, shows in a synopsis that the set of planning tools established in theGerman coastal region meets in part the ICZM demands for negotiation, integration and appropriateconsideration of the ecological aspects of sustainability. In view of this background, the implementation ofICZM in Germany should, in our view, be carried out on the basis of the existing legal planning framework.However, the analysis also revealed substantial deficits.Therefore, implementation of ICZM in Germany is notpossible without a number of adaptations and extensions ofthe planning tools, which are designated asrecommendations for action. In addition to the required broadening ofthe opportunities for participation, therecommendations focus especially on significant strengthening and extension of regional planning in generaland of the regional planning procedure in particular. A number of recommendations, such as that for relativereinforcement of the ecological aspect of sustainability and for improvement of territorial integration, also referbeyond planning processes to more fundamental aspects of the governmental and political decision-makingsystem.", "title_en": "Retrospektive Analyse größerer Planverfahren in der Küstenzone unter der Perspektive \"IKZM-Tauglichkeit\""}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4261540-9", "gnd:4121387-7"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:5191072-X", "year": "2004", "type": "Report", "language_original": "de"}}

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A479453624", "content": {"text": "Analytical ultracentrifugation of polymers and nanoparticles : 5 tables. Analytical ultracentifugation (AUC) is a powerful method for the characterization of polymers, biopolymers, polyelectrolytes, nanoparticles, dispersions, and other colloidal systems. The method is able to determine the molar mass, the particle size, the particle density and interaction parameters like virial coefficients and association constants. Because AUC is also a fractionation method, the determination of the molar mass distribution, the particle size distribution, and the particle density distribution is possible. A special technique, the density gradient method, allows fractionating heterogeneous samples according to their chemical nature that means being able to detect chemical heterogeneity. The book is divided into chapters concerning instrumentation, sedimentation velocity runs, density gradient runs, application examples and future developments. In particular, the detailed application chapter demonstrates the versatility and power of AUC by means of many interesting and important industrial examples. Thus the book concentrates on practical aspects rather than details of centrifugation theory.

This extensive and increasing use of embedded systems and their integration in everyday products mark a significant evolution in information science and technology. Nowadays embedded systems design is subject to seamless integration with the physical and electronic environment while meeting requirements like reliability, availability, robustness, power consumption, cost, and deadlines. Thus, embedded systems design raises challenging problems for research, such as security, reliable and mobile services, large-scale heterogeneous distributed systems, adaptation, component-based development, and validation and tool-based certification. This book results from the ARTIST FP5 project funded by the European Commision. By integration 28 leading European research institutions with many top researchers in the area, this book assesses and strategically advances the state of the art in embedded systems. The coherently written monograph-like book is a valuable source of reference for researchers active in the field and serves well as an introduction to scientists and professionals interested in learning about embedded systems design", "title_en": "Embedded systems design : the ARTIST roadmap for research and development"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4116522-6", "gnd:4131397-5", "gnd:4396978-1", "gnd:4159103-3", "gnd:4496068-2"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2005", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

In all applications (telecommunications, hands-free communications, recording, human-machine interfaces, etc.) that require at least one microphone, the signal of interest is usually contaminated by noise and reverberation. As a result, the microphone signal has to be \"cleaned\" with digital signal processing tools before it is played out, transmitted, or stored. This book is about speech enhancement. Different well-known and state-of-the-art methods for noise reduction, with one or multiple microphones, are discussed. By speech enhancement, we mean not only noise reduction but also dereverberation and separation of independent signals. These topics are also covered in this book. However, the general emphasis is on noise reduction because of the large number of applications that can benefit from this technology. The goal of this book is to provide a strong reference for researchers, engineers, and graduate students who are interested in the problem of signal and speech enhancement. To do so, we invited well-known experts to contribute chapters covering the state of the art in this focused field.

In today's increasing complex and uncertain business environment, financial analysis is yet more critical to business managers who tackle the problems of an economic or business nature. Knowledge based on formal logic and even experience becomes less sufficient. This volume systematically sets out the basic elements on which to base financial analysis for business in the new century. It incorporates a previous work that can serve as the basis and foundation to the new contributions that are now being made in the field of financial economy and intend to provide business with instruments and models that are suitable for the treatment of the new economic context. In dealing with rapid and unpredictable changes in technological and business conditions, it postulates a growing reliance on the opinions of experts instead of past data or probabilistic forecasts, which is a radical change but may yield fruitful results. For this reason, much emphasis is devoted to the problem of aggregation of the opinion of experts in the financial field, with the object of limiting, wherever possible, the subjective component of the opinions and making sure that the decisions have the best guarantee of reaching the desired objectives", "title_en": "Fuzzy logic in financial analysis"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4341284-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Gil-Lafuente, Anna Maria", "year": "2005", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

Beginning with a comprehensive survey of existing semiconductor-based chemical microsensors and microsystems, this book proceeds to describe in detail CMOS technology-based chemical microsensor systems. The benefits of using CMOS-technology for developing chemical microsensor systems and, in particular, monolithically integrated sensor systems comprising transducers and associated circuitry are laid out. Several successful realizations of such microsensor systems are presented. First, the fundamentals of the chemical sensing process itself will be elucidated followed by a short description of microfabrication techniques and the CMOS substrate. Thereafter, a comprehensive overview of semiconductor-based and CMOS-based transducer structures and their applications is given. It is shown that CMOS-technology can be successfully used as platform technology to integrate microtransducers with the necessary driving and signal conditioning circuitry, and, in a next step, to develop monolithic multisensor arrays and fully developed microsystems with on-chip sensor control and standard interfaces. The book concludes with a brief outlook to future developments such as interfacing cells with CMOS microelectronics.

This book offers a novel perspective that allows to incorporate changing consumption and production structure into models of economic growth. Starting from the empirical observation that income and consumption structure are closely related, it develops a tractable theoretical framework which enables to analyze macroeconomic models consistent with these empirical facts. As a result, central macroeconomic phenomena are better understood: the reasons behind long-run growth, structural change, and the influence of inequality on innovations and growth.

Used in ancient oriental medicine as a source of bioactive compounds, sea cucumbers, sea stars and sea urchins are now used for the extraction and purification of cytotoxic, haemolytic, antiviral, antifungal, antifouling, antimicrobial and even anti-tumoural activities. In addition, of the five extant classes, sea urchins and sea cucumbers are important economic resources for current fishery and aquaculture. Molecular and cell biological techniques described in this book are, on the one hand, indicative of the improvements made over the years and, on the other, stress the need of their further exploitation for the sustainable production of bioactive compounds and their application in biomedicine.

POSEIDON No 316 was a multidisciplinary cruise addressing biological, geological and hydrographical scientific objectives in the carbonate mound and aphotic coral province west of Ireland in the eastern Porcupine Seabight and at the western Rockall Bank. The main objective was to investigate the interrelation between the rich aphotic coral ecosystems found in these regions and diurnal and seasonal processes in the ambient hydro-dynamical and depositional regime as these factors seem to bias the conditions of coral growth and reproduction. The cruise started in Reykjavik and ended in Lisbon and continued the 2004 investigations in the Irish carbonate mound province with FS METEOR (M61 leg 1, 20040418 - 20040505). The scientific work is embedded in the \"ESF-DFG\" Moundforce project of the EUROMARGINS Programme. Together with the previous M61 cruise, the POSEIDON activities document Germany's strong scientific and logistic support for the success of this challenging programme. Investigations are also designed as a preparatory cruise for the EU-project HERMES (Hotspot Ecosystem Research on the Margins of European Seas; start 20050401).

The hierarchical organization of files has dominated computer systems for many years and this will probably not change in the near future. However, with the rapid annual growth of new data this classical hierarchical file system management method reaches its limitations, even when the user consistently sets up and continually expands an elaborated directory structure with well-disciplined naming. This paper introduces new management methods to maintain an overview of all files which can be embedded in the hierarchical file system. A metadata-based file system, which is based on the hierarchical file system, offers, in addition to hierarchical access, a more flexible and associative access to files via virtual objects by providing query capabilities of index- and metadata which are stored in a database. The query results are presented in a clearly-arranged form of virtual directories and virtual files so that the intuitive hierarchical view continues to be maintained ...", "title_en": "Einbettung neuer Verwaltungsmethoden in die hierarchische Dateisystemsicht"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4256353-7", "gnd:4464537-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2005", "type": "Report", "language_original": "de"}}

Griffith's fracture criterion describes in a quasistatic setting whether or not a pre-existing crack in an elastic body is stationary for given external forces. In terms of the energy release rate (ERR), which is the derivative of the deformation energy of the body with respect to a virtual crack extension, this criterion reads: If the ERR is less than a specific constant, then the crack is stationary, otherwise it will grow. In this paper, we consider geometrically nonlinear elastic models with polyconvex energy densities and prove that the ERR is well defined. Moreover, without making any assumption on the smoothness of minimizers, we derive rigorously the well-known Griffith formula and the $J$-integral, from which the ERR can be calculated. The proofs are based on a weak convergence result for Eshelby tensors.", "title_en": "Energy release rate for cracks in finite-strain elasticity"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:1120622891", "gnd:4204381-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2006", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is the international treaty under which the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) are adopted. ISPMs enable the development of technically justified measures for imported plants and plant products, and are intended to harmonize phytosanitary measures applied in international trade. These standards are the accepted reference under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). The use and transboundary shipment of sterile insects was not part of ISPM No. 3, \"Code of Conduct for the Import and Release of Exotic Biological Control Agents\" adopted in 1995, because biological control agents had been defined as self-replicating organisms. Since the implementation of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has largely been dominated by the public sector, this did not represent a problem for the transboundary shipment of sterile insects. However, the lack of regulatory framework did discourage private investment in the production and shipment of sterile insects.Over the last three years (2002-2005) ISPM No. 3 has undergone a major revision to update and broaden its scope. In particular, we have been involved in explicitly including sterile insects as beneficials in the revised standard. The revised ISPM No.3 \"Guidelines for the Export, Shipment, Import, and Release of Biological Control Agents and Other Beneficial Organisms\" was drafted in 2004 and submitted for country consultation. The revised ISPM No. 3 was adopted by the governing body of the IPPC, the Interim Commission for Phytosanitary Measures (ICPM), in April 2005 at FAO headquarters in Rome. Thus sterile insects are considered in parallel to other beneficial organisms by the IPPC through the adoption of the revised ISPM No. 3 and this should facilitate their use, especially in terms of commercialization of the SIT and international trade of sterile insects.--Publisher's description", "title_en": "Guidance for packing, shipping, holding and release of sterile flies in area-wide fruit fly control programmes : Joint FAO/IAEA Programme of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4063118-7", "gnd:4155333-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2007", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

In last two decades of 20th Century, accelerated anthropogenic activities pushed up the atmospheric abundance of greenhouse gases, mainly CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O, alarmingly which enhanced the radiative forcing of the Earth's surface and thus perturbed its heat radiation balance. As a consequence, atmospheric characteristics, such as temperature, rainfall pattern, levels of CO₂ and O₃ have changed significantly, affecting the farm productivity. Although rising level of CO₂ may have fertilizing effect on C₃ crops, but concomitant rise in atmospheric temperature, O₃ level and extreme weather conditions can not only nullify the fertilizing effect of CO₂, but also drastically reduce the crop production, threatening food security to burgeoning world population. Agricultural crops are not only victim of climate variability and extreme whether conditions, but also serve as a potential source of CH₄ and N₂O. Therefore, in changed scenario, Kyoto Protocol (1997) has sought all signatory developed nations to cut down their emission levels as per their differential commitments to UNFCCC and developing nations to invest in less carbon emission projects to avert the process of global warming process. In this context, the present edition, which compiles latest findings of studies carried out by the scientists on climate change and crops around the world, serves as a ready reckoner to crop scientists, atmospheric scientists, ecologists, environmentalists, research scholars and post- graduate students to update their knowledge and understanding on this issue. -- Book jacket", "title_en": "Climate change and crops"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4290733-0"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2009", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

About 15% of European workers report handling chemical products for a quarter of their working time and 19% report breathing in dust, fumes and smoke in their workplaces. The 49 experts from 21 European countries who participated in this forecast highlighted particles and dusts as major emerging concerns and put nanoparticles at the top of the list of emerging risks. Other main groups of emerging risks identified were carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic substances, and the increasing use of allergenic and sensitizing substances. Specific occupations of emerging concerns were also highlighted and include the increasing waste management industry, construction, and service activities such as cleaning or home nursing. In addition, there is a growing number of workers in SMEs and sub-contracted jobs, where the management of chemical risks is generally poorer.

{"paper_id": "TIBKAT%3A725792477", "content": {"text": "Industrial case study on the integration of SysML and AUTOSAR with triple graph grammars. During the overall development of complex engineering systems different modeling notations are employed. For example, in the domain of automotive systems system engineering models are employed quite early to capture the requirements and basic structuring of the entire system, while software engineering models are used later on to describe the concrete software architecture. Each model helps in addressing the specific design issue with appropriate notations and at a suitable level of abstraction. However, when we step forward from system design to the software design, the engineers have to ensure that all decisions captured in the system design model are correctly transferred to the software engineering model. Even worse, when changes occur later on in either model, today the consistency has to be reestablished in a cumbersome manual step.

The increasing worldwide trend in disasters, which will be aggravated by global environmental change, urges us to implement new approaches to hazard mitigation, as well as exposure and vulnerability reduction. Ecosystem management is a well-tested solution to sustainable development that is being revisited because of its inherent “win–win” and “no-regrets” appeal to address rising disaster and climate change issues. It is one of the few approaches that can impact all elements of the disaster risk equation – mitigating hazards, reducing exposure, reducing vulnerabilities and increasing the resilience of exposed communities. Yet, the uptake of ecosystem-based approaches for disaster risk reduction (DRR) is slow despite some very good examples of success stories. Reasons for this are multiple: ecosystem management is rarely considered as part of the portfolio of DRR solutions because the environmental and disaster management communities typically work independently from each other; its contribution to DRR is highly undervalued compared to engineered solutions and thus not attributed appropriate budget allocations.", "title_en": "The role of ecosystems in disaster risk reduction"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:7675980-5", "gnd:4041387-1"]}, "metadata": {"authors": null, "year": "2013", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

This paper focuses on rate-independent damage in elastic bodies. Since the driving energy is nonconvex, solutions may have jumps as a function of time, and in this situation it is known that the classical concept of energetic solutions for rate-independent systems may fail to accurately describe the behavior of the system at jumps. Therefore, we resort to the (by now well-established) vanishing viscosity approach to rate-independent modeling and approximate the model by its viscous regularization. In fact, the analysis of the latter PDE system presents remarkable difficulties, due to its highly nonlinear character.

The success breeds success hypothesis has been mainly applied to theoretical network approaches. We investigate the European aerospace industry using data on the European Framework Programmes and on Airbus suppliers, focusing on the success breeds success hypothesis at four levels of analysis: the spatial structure of the European aerospace R&D collaboration network, its topological architecture, the individual actors that make up the network, and through a comparison of the Airbus invention and production networks. On the spatial level, SBS is favored: successful regions maintain their position and grow on a large scale, especially so for regions that have strongly participated from the very beginning. The regional hub structure is mirrored in the architecture of the European aerospace R&D collaboration network, where well-connected hub organizations play a key role in shaping the structure of the network through their many collaborative partnerships and do so in a way that strategically positions themselves with greater ability to access and regulate knowledge flows, as assessed by several centrality measures. Only successful organizations have the ability to form so many ties, with success thus breeding success in the European aerospace R&D collaboration network. The importance of the core organizations made clear through the centrality analysis is further supported by the analysis of weak ties, where we observe that the core organizations are connected to the rest of the network with many weak ties, thereby confirming their outstanding positions in the European aerospace R&D collaboration network as being able to access knowledge or other resources. With the combination of the R&D collaboration network and the Airbus production network on a spatial level, we see additional support for SBS, as those regions whose actors are frequent participants in both networks show the greatest share of successful actors.

Project description: Despite its importance for the production process and properties of fiberboard, the quality of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) is principally determined with a haptic and visual inspection by skilled personnel, as adequate measurement systems are currently not available. This approach depends greatly on the person testing the material, and the results obtained are only quantifiable to a limited extent. Results are therefore unsuitable for objective product and process optimization. While the hardware and software of the automated image-based fiber analysis system applied were developed in the context of two previous projects, the current project aimed to investigate the influence of fiber composition and process parameters, particularly the refining parameters, on the fiber quality and the impact of the fiber quality on the properties of medium-density fiberboard (MDF). With this objective, characteristic values have been developed in order to quantify the fiber quality. Various fibers were produced and characterized. The obtained results were correlated with the parameters of the fiber production process as well as the mechanical properties of MDF made from these fibers. The scientific-technical results were verified in industrial trials when the measuring device was installed in the production process of an MDF manufacturer ...

Dieses Verfahren ist im hohen Maße von der prüfenden Person abhängig sowie das Ergebnis nur begrenzt quantifizierbar und daher für eine objektiv-gezielte Produkt- und Prozessoptimierung ungeeignet. Während im Rahmen von zwei Vorgängerprojekte Hard- und Software zur automatisierten Bildanalyse-basierten Vermessung von TMP entwickelt wurde, hatte das aktuelle Vorhaben die Untersuchung des Einflusses der Rohstoffheterogenität und der Produktionsbedingungen - insbesondere der Refiner-Parameter - auf die Faserstoffqualität sowie den Einfluss der Faserstoffqualität auf die Eigenschaften von Mitteldichten Faserplatten (engl.: medium-density fiberboard; kurz MDF) zum Ziel. Hierfür wurden zunächst Kenngrößen entwickelt, mit denen die Qualität von Faserstoffen beschrieben werden können. Anschließend wurden verschiedene Faserstoffe erzeugt, mit dem zuvor entwickelten Messgerät charakterisiert und die erzielten Ergebnisse mit den Prozessparametern der Faserstofferzeugung sowie den mechanisch-technologischen Eigenschaften der aus diesen Faserstoffen hergestellten MDF in Zusammenhang gestellt.

These floating domiciles showcase alternative living solutions from the private to the commercial. From the romantic lakes of Kashmir to the Bay of Venice, houseboats claim their space atop the water worldwide. These charismatic and aquatic homes provide refuge from being landlocked and promise to satisfy curious natures. A Life Afloat profiles the imaginative inhabitants and designers behind these houseboats; the volume offers inspiration to anyone interested in a touch of escape from a weekend change of scenery to a permanent change of address", "title_en": "Rock the boat : boats, cabins and homes on the water"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4159233-5", "gnd:4072819-5"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:2143498-0", "year": "2017", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

In the existing literature the estimation of the effect of unilateral climate change policy measures and their effectiveness is done primarily in ”Computable General Equilibrium“ (CGE) models or based on “Integrated Assessment Models” (IAM). The selection of parameter values for the required calibration of the models is often ad hoc and based on various studies that are neither consistent to each other nor with the theoretical modeling. The objective of this project is to develop consistent and integrated approaches to enhance climate change policy advice. For this purpose, the structure of the estimated equations is derived from research results and based on theoretically modeling and thus links the estimated and micro-founded results with consistently constructed CGE-models which are then employed for the analysis of climate policy scenarios. This represents a significant methodological development to existing Integrated Assessment Models and in particular combines the research in the international trade area with that of climate debate. The results of the project include: • Construction of well suited databases to be used for the analysis of international climate policy • Evaluating the instruments of international climate change policy • Development of indices for international climate change policies • Prognosis of the welfare effects of climate change policy objectives with a special focus on the long term consequences • Conveying the findings to a wide audience Die Abschätzung der Effekte unilateraler Klimapolitik-Maßnahmen sowie deren Wirksamkeit geschieht in der bestehenden Literatur vornehmlich durch „Computable General Equilibrium“ (CGE) Modelle oder durch darauf basierende Integrated Assessment Modelle. Die Auswahl der zur Kalibrierung der Modelle benötigten Daten erfolgt jedoch häufig ad hoc und auf der Grundlage unterschiedlicher Studien, die weder untereinander noch mit der theoretischen Modellierung konsistent sind. Zielsetzung des Projekts war die Entwicklung von konsistenten und integrierten Ansätzen zur Verbesserung der Klimapolitikberatung. Dazu wurde auf Forschungsergebnissen aufgebaut welche die Struktur der Schätzgleichungen aus der theoretischen Modellierung herleiten und die geschätzten mikro-fundierten Zusammenhänge in entsprechenden CGE-Modellen zur Analyse klimapolitischer Rahmenbedingungen berücksichtigen. Dies stellt einen bedeutenden methodischen Fortschritt zu bestehenden Integrated Assessment Modellen dar und verbindet insbesondere die Forschung im Bereich des internationalen Handels mit der Klimadebatte. Zu den Ergebnissen des Projekts zählen: • Aufbau geeigneter Datenbanken zur Analyse internationaler Klimapolitik • Bewertung der Instrumente internationaler Klimapolitik • Entwicklung von Indizes zum internationalen Vergleich klimapolitischer Maßnahmen • Prognose der Wohlfahrtswirkungen klimapolitischer Ziele mit besonderem Fokus auf den langfristigen Folgewirkungen • Vermittlung der Erkenntnisse an ein breites Publikum", "title_en": "Integrierte Bewertung der Instrumente und der fiskalischen und marktbasierten Anreize internationaler Klimapolitik und ihrer Auswirkungen (IACCP) : Studie gefördet vom Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung : im Rahmen von FONA - Ökonomie des Klimawandels - BMBF"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:7547705-1", "gnd:4224214-9"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "Montoya Gómez, Ana Maria; Ciesielski, Anna Sophia", "year": "2017", "type": "Report", "language_original": "de"}}

New programming language designs are often evaluated on concrete implementations. However, in order to draw conclusions about the language design from the evaluation of concrete programming languages, these implementations need to be verified against the formalism of the design. To that end, we also have to ensure that the design actually meets its stated goals. A useful tool for the latter has been to create an executable semantics from a formalism that can execute a test suite of examples. However, this mechanism so far did not allow to verify an implementation against the design. Babelsberg is a new design for a family of object-constraint languages. Recently, we have developed a formal semantics to clarify some issues in the design of those languages. Supplementing this work, we report here on how this formalism is turned into an executable operational semantics using the RML system. Furthermore, we show how we extended the executable semantics to create a framework that can generate test suites for the concrete Babelsberg implementations that provide traceability from the design to the language. Finally, we discuss how these test suites helped us find and correct mistakes in the Babelsberg implementation for JavaScript.", "title_en": "Babelsberg/RML : Executable semantics and language testing with RML"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4293502-7", "gnd:4680186-8", "gnd:4141876-1", "gnd:4545513-2", "gnd:4653817-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:1107047137; gnd:1250721-0; gnd:1107045525; gnd:1107044839; gnd:120012162", "year": "2016", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}

Despite the increasing availability of spatial count data in research areas like technology spillovers, patenting activities, insurance payments, and crime forecasting, specialized models for analysing such data have received little attention in econometric literature so far. The few existing approaches can be broadly classified into observation-driven models, where the random spatial effects enter the moments of the dependent variable directly, and parameterdriven models, where the random spatial effects are unobservable and induced via a latent process. Moreover, within these groups the modelling approaches (and therefore the interpretation) of spatial effects are quite heterogeneous, stemming in part from the nonlinear structure of count data models. The purpose of this survey is to compare and contrast the various approaches for econometric modelling of spatial counts discussed in the literature.", "title_en": "A review of spatial econometric models for count data"}, "subject": {"labels": ["gnd:4588029-3"]}, "metadata": {"authors": "gnd:112919387X", "year": "2017", "type": "Report", "language_original": "en"}}
